You make us so sad. We liked you and your pop-y music so much when you were just a shaggy-hair little boy and we think you’re growing up into a very handsome young man. Too bad your personality is just killing it for you. Your bad boy image isn’t our favorite, and we think that it’s probably not even you. We’ve seen you with Ellen DeGeneres and we saw you with that bowling instructor having a very difficult time being impolite and disrespectful even though the point of the show on which you were on was to say what was being said to you in your secret ear microphone. We don’t know what happened to you, but feel free to go back to being sweet again. It worked so much better for you.</p><p>We thought maybe you were working on your image and you were going to succeed, but then you get kicked out of Coachella, where pretty much anything goes. How does that even happen? Now, we get that you wanted to get into that Drake concert – especially after hearing that Madonna made out with him probably much to his horror. The <a href=#>Biebs</a> flashed his wristband and reportedly went about using his fame to try and get into a venue that was filled to capacity, and it didn’t work for him. He was reportedly placed in a chokehold and ushered out of the venue.</p><p>While we are actually proud that he didn’t beat anyone up, yell, scream or behave offensively, it would have worked better to just walk away when asked and not try to pull the fame card. Oh, who are we kidding? If we were Justin Bieber, we’d try to pull the famous person card, too. That’s why people become famous, right? To have that kind of access?</p><p>Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGibopyeqXq1rcqeZKWnnpx6q8HSraCnZZKesqOx0WaenqxdmLWwt8SdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-sean-mcgee-still-alive-is-sean-mcgee-dead-what-happened-to-sean-mcgee-did-sean-mcgee-kill-himself-10005518.html><span>←</span><span>Is Sean Mcgee Still Alive?
