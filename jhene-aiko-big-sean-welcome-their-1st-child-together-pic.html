They released a joint album under Twenty88 on a collaborative project that same year. In 2017, Aiko went on to tattoo Big Sean’s face on the back of her arm.</p><p>The Twenty88 performer is already <a href=#>mom to 13-year-old daughter</a>&nbsp;Namiko, with whom she shares with ex <strong>O’Ryan</strong>.</p><p>Aiko opened up about motherhood during an episode of <a href=#>Vice Autobiographies</a> in November 2016.</p><p>“In 2008, I got pregnant with my daughter. She made me feel fearless,” Aiko shared at the time. “I never doubted that something good would come from it. If anything, it was inspiring and it just gave me this extra, extra drive.”</p><p>Aiko and O’Ryan were together from 2005 to 2008, splitting shortly after she gave birth to their daughter.</p><p>The “None of Your Concern” singer and “Hate Our Love” singer, for their part, <a href=#>broke up in December 2018</a> before reconciling in early 2020.</p><p>“We’re just so close, I don’t know,” Aiko <a href=#>exclusively told Us in 2019</a>. “We’re definitely, we’re actually a lot alike. We’re a lot alike, so it is really easy for us to collaborate. … We’re constantly just feeding off each other, or, giving each other little ideas, little bars here and there, and like, ‘Oh, maybe you shouldn’t say that. Maybe you should say it a little more like this.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aiko went on to gush about her beau in March. “happy birthday to the most talented, hardworking, anime, dc, marvel, movie, tv show nerd 🥰 you are the GOAT !! a living light and a living legend 🤩 you’re a major source of inspiration and joy for everyone lucky enough to know you 🥲i hope 34 is your best year yet and you get everything you wish for 🥰 you deserve it ✨ i love you 💙,” she <a href=#>shared via Instagram</a>.</p><p>Big Sean, meanwhile, <a href=#>posted a compilation of photos</a> from <a href=#>Coachella&nbsp;</a>in April, almost all including Aiko. “Life is as fun as it looks out in the dessert @jheneaiko 🌵🤟🏾🌐💫🖤,” the rapper wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajoJWjsm6tyKSmZpqZnHq0scCnZLCdnJi8rrGMrZ%2BeoaJifrTAjJyfoqSUYsGws8Stn56qXaW2pHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-goldstein-cause-of-death-and-obituary-who-was-jay-goldstein.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Goldstein Cause of Death And Obituary ?
