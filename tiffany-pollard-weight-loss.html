The Flavor of Love star's fans are worried about her getting shockingly skinny all of a sudden and they are convinced that she is taking Ozempic. Tiffany Pollard has yet to acknowledge her dramatic weight loss.</strong></p><p><strong>Tiffany Pollard</strong>, the self-proclaimed Head B*tch in Charge (HBIC), rose to fame when she appeared in the first two seasons of VH1's Flavor of Love. The <a href=#><strong>reality star</strong></a> leveraged the clout she got from the show to make her own spin-off I Love New York. She was very temperamental and of an outspoken nature in the show which paved the way for her being an instant fan-favorite.</p><p>Her fans have been with her since then and they take a deep interest in her and her life. So, you can imagine the buzz it created when she recently revealed her extreme weight loss. It's been a long time since she was skinny like that and even then, she looked healthy but now, she just looks plain scarily thin. Here's everything to know about Tiffany Pollard's weight loss!</p><p>You might also be interested in the <a href=#><strong>weight loss</strong></a> stories of <a href=#><strong>Eugenia Cooney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Marlo Hampton</strong></a>.</p><h2>Tiffany 'New York' Pollard's Weight Gain 2023: Fans Are Convinced She's Taking Ozempic!</h2><p><strong>Tiffany Pollard</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@tiffany_hbic_pollard</a>) has undergone significant weight loss and it's for everyone to see on her Instagram page. Her latest post has shocked all her followers because it has revealed the extreme change in her appearance. She's gotten a lot skinnier and people are concerned for her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/09/tiffany-pollard-pic1.jpg alt="Tiffany Pollard had an extreme weight loss that has sent her fans to a frenzy. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Tiffany Pollard had an extreme weight loss that has sent her fans to a frenzy.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: The Cut</strong></p><p>I can't tell if Tiffany expected it or not when she posted that picture of hers that it would create a ruckus on social media (I mean she had to know what was going to happen, right, she cannot be unaware of the extreme transformation that she's been through) but it has happened. She took to Instagram to show off her new look with a picture of herself dressed in leopard print pants and a figure-hugging black turtleneck. Her new look after her weight loss, as you guessed if you have seen the pictures, was shocking, to say the least.</p><p>Tiffany Pollard casually posed in front of a bedroom mirror to give her followers a glimpse of her outfit which only sparked concerns for her health among them because she looked extremely thin, unhealthily thin. She had gotten so skinny to the point of looking unrecognizable. Several of her followers couldn't tell at first that it was her after seeing the picture. Her weight loss completely changed her. She didn't even look like herself is what many of them commented on her posts.</p><p>As soon as they placed her, they started to worry about her because she did not just look skinny as in she got fitter and more slender but she got skinny as in she looked unhealthily thin, anorexic thin. Like anybody could tell she would not look that skinny naturally. Most of them seemed to agree that she 'was not the same person and that was the body of an anorexic woman' and that her weight loss was definitely not natural.</p><p>Tiffany Pollard's followers are convinced that she is the latest one to join the celebrity circle who's been using Ozempic as a shortcut to lose weight quickly and with less effort. After all, 'it is not very normal for a woman of her age to be that thin.' While some of them were majorly disappointed in her that she <a href=# rel=noopener>chose to have Ozempic</a> for weight loss, there were others who felt sympathetic towards her that she even felt the need to do so when she was already beautiful at her normal weight because of the impossible beauty standards. Now, her face just looks gaunt and scarily thin.</p><h2>Tiffany Pollard Only Returned to Her Normal Weight After Her Weight Loss!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/09/tiffany-pollard-pic2.jpg alt="Tiffany Pollard's fans think she used Ozempic to lose weight. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Tiffany Pollard's fans think she used Ozempic to lose weight.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Vulture</strong></p><p>However, some people didn't think that <strong>Tiffany Pollard</strong> had Ozempic for weight loss at all. They didn't find her to be much different from how she looked when she had just begun to film Flavour of Love. As they said, she was always a skinny legend. They thought that people were unable to recognize her only because she got more weight in the following years and they forgot how she looked in the beginning.</p><p>According to them, she is just keeping up with the trends. She got breast implants when being curvy and voluptuous was in fashion and now that we have entered the anti-BBL and thin trend, she decided to return to her normal weight - the weight she was at when she first joined reality television - by undoing whatever procedures she had before such as breast implants.</p><p>To those who believe that Tiffany Pollard has not had unnatural weight loss using Ozempic, others counter that though it's true that she <a href=# rel=noopener>looked skinny in the beginning</a>, she really doesn't look the same as she did back then. 'When she was thinner in the past, she looked very healthy and unnatural' whereas now, she just looks extremely scarily skinny. It's scary how thin she looks and not like 'fitness goal.'</p><p><strong>She looks way too skinny, bobble headed now she looked fine and slim but healthy on flavor of love.</strong></p><p>While most of them believed that Tiffany Pollard used Ozempic for weight loss, others seemed to think it was her habit of smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee all day to suppress her appetite that is to be credited for her transformation. She always seemed to have issues with weight and food and it appears as though her issues have amounted to that. However, she has not acknowledged any of that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGirop6Wlru6ec%2Boo6WZopl6uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jules-daoud.html><span>←</span><span>Things You Should Know Regarding Jules Daoud</span></a>
