And many believe that the boy in the video is Gomez’s new boyfriend. However, the face of her alleged boyfriend isn’t seen, and thus, his identity remains unknown.</p><p>Right after that story, Gomez <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/stories/siennamaegomez/2874525160570700293/ rel="noreferrer noopener">reshared</a> a quote from an Instagram page that read, “One day you’ll realize that God was putting it all together the whole time.” The quote might be referring to her newfound love as well as her return to social media after a long hiatus.</p><p>Coming back to her alleged boyfriend, it’s already established that his face wasn’t shown in the video, due to which his identity, including his name, is unknown. However, it might be possible that the two might have been dating for a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sienna-mae-gomez-boyfriend.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Sienna Mae Gomez getting hugged by her alleged new boyfriend (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>It could be said so because Gomez hadn’t revealed anything about her personal life since her last relationship with fellow TikTok star <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/jack-wright/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Wright</a> — a relationship due to which she got a lot of backlashes as she was accused of sexually assaulting Wright.</p><p>Additionally, she was getting canceled due to those allegations — many of which Gomez had declined — and she ultimately had to leave social media for a long time. She finally marked her return to social media on May 29, 2022.</p><p>And as all those allegations and backlashes were there, and they still are, Gomez might have kept her new relationship hidden from the outside world until now. However, as nothing is confirmed, it remains to be seen when Gomez and her alleged new boyfriend actually started dating.</p><p>Moreover, this isn’t Gomez’s first vacation to the same place in Oahu, Hawaii, as she has been there multiple times over the past few years. So, it could be said that Oahu, Hawaii, is her go-to place or second home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Her <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CX1nB4GvIUB/ rel="noreferrer noopener">first post</a> in Oahu, Hawaii, was seen on December 24, 2021. Similarly, on June 24, 2022, she <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CfKPT-Msy6t/ rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> a TikTok video made at the same place with the caption, “THE VIEW!!?” Under that post, Gomez’s friend, Summer Colmus, had commented, “maybe you should come back for this view!!”</p><p>In reply to the comment, Gomez said she misses Colmus and will visit the place soon. And as promised, she went there in late June 2022 and posted a picture from there on June 30.</p><p>And one more picture from the same place was shared on Sunday, July 3, 2022 — the same day she posted a short clip with her alleged new boyfriend. So, it could be assumed that she visited the place with her partner.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Colleen Ballinger Claims She Lost Broadway Role amid Grooming Accusations</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>“I was really sad about that,” said the YouTuber.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Colleen-Ballinger-Broadway.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/colleen-ballinger/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Colleen Ballinger</a> has been facing backlash, and multiple companies have ended ties with her since she was accused of grooming young viewers.</p><p>The YouTuber has since been sharing her “dark times” following the accusations. Now, the YouTuber has opened up about how she lost out on a Broadway audition last year over her grooming allegations.</p><p>On Thursday, January 11, 2024, Ballinger <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPRxUghF7Q" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uploaded</a> a new vlog on her YouTube channel titled ‘My Big Audition!’ In the new video, she went into the details of losing out on a big Broadway opportunity.</p><p>She mentioned that the auditions didn’t work out and was sad about it. She also said that she lost the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/broadway-show/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Broadway</a> opportunity right after she was accused of grooming, an accusation which she claimed was made up.</p><p>She stated, “It didn’t work out and I was really sad about that. I’m not going to get super into it but obviously, a lot happened last year, a lot was said last year. I lost that opportunity right after a story came out about me that was just completely made up and it is what it is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sienna-Mae-Gomez-new-boyfriend.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Colleen Ballinger talks about losing out on a Broadway opportunity in her new YouTube video (Photo: YouTube)</p><p>“We’re moving forward. I already got to do a Broadway show, and I’m so grateful for that. What a cool, wonderful, and beautiful experience that was for me,” Ballinger added. She said she was grateful for that opportunity as it was her ultimate dream to be on Broadway.</p><p>Her statement read, “I’m so grateful that I ever got to do it because my ultimate dream, if you know me at all since I was a little girl, was to be on Broadway.” She further reflected on the opportunity and admitted that she was “excited to see that dream come true again.”</p><p>But Ballinger then reconciled with the fact that the “dream has already come true.” As she continued, she said she finally understood why her viewers wanted an update, as she had conveyed so much of the audition process in her videos throughout 2023.</p><p>She stated, “I shared that audition process with you, so I understand why everyone is so curious to know what happened, but I’m not going to sit here and have a pity party about it. I definitely already had a pity party about that one, believe me, and now I’m just trying to look at everything with a different lens.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/exclusive/jeffree-star-collen-ballinger-grooming/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Ballinger’s grooming accusations</a> first surfaced in 2020 when Adam McIntyre, a former fan and YouTuber, spoke up against her. He accused her of grooming him and claimed that her behavior towards her fans wasn’t good.</p><p>However, nobody believed McIntyre then, and many of Ballinger’s fans defended her and accused McIntyre of lying. This led to the topic being faded and forgotten until McIntyre uploaded another video about Ballinger on June 4, 2023.</p><p>In the video, which was over an hour long, he opened up about his relationship with Ballinger and how he felt she was using him and other fans as per her needs. Likewise, in another video, he mentioned being a part of a group chat with Ballinger and other fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>McIntyre claimed that when all of this was happening, Ballinger was already in her 30s, whereas most of the fans in the group chat were between 14 and 16. But the age didn’t stop Ballinger from commenting on their looks, encouraging bullying, and asking inappropriate questions.</p><p>“This woman groomed me,” McIntyre mentioned. Additionally, McIntyre showed multiple screenshots of his time in the group chats. Some of the pictures showed Ballinger asking very inappropriate questions.</p><p>As McIntyre went on, he claimed that Ballinger, also known as Miranda Sings, used love-bombing to make him feel special and praised and encouraged him to run her social media handles without pay. All this ultimately ended their friendship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>McIntyre later realized that Ballinger had been grooming him and decided to stand up and talk about his experience. Since he spoke against her, other fans in the group chat have also opened up about their experiences of being groomed or used by Ballinger.</p><p>In addition to Ballinger, fans have accused the YouTuber’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/rachel-ballinger/ rel="noreferrer noopener">sister, Rachel</a>, and her best friend, Kory DeSoto, of grooming. All three have received major backlash since the grooming scandal came to light, and many sponsors have ended their contracts.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Bruno Mars’ Relationship with Girlfriend Jessica Caban Reportedly in Shambles</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>“They are living separate lives,” said the source.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bruno-Mars-Girlfriend.jpg alt="Bruno Mars’ Relationship with Girlfriend Jessica Caban Reportedly in Shambles" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>It looks like the end is near for <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/bruno-mars/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruno Mars</a>’ long-time relationship with his girlfriend, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/jessica-caban/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Caban</a>.</p><p>As per reports, the American singer-songwriter and his girlfriend’s relationship might end up in a break up, considering the two are reportedly living apart as of this moment.</p><p>On Wednesday, January 10, 2024, an inside source close to the couple told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/25315133/bruno-mars-girlfriend-jessica-caban-relationship/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> that Mars and Caban weren’t together to celebrate Christmas and New Year’s Eve. The source also stressed that Mars’ busy touring schedule has kept them apart.</p><p>The source, a friend of the love birds, stated, “Bruno and Jessica barely spend time together anymore — it is really sad. They are living separate lives, so it doesn’t bode well for their relationship. It feels like things are fizzling out between them.”</p><p>“They have so much history together, but we aren’t sure whether they will be able to save things this time. It would be hard for them to say goodbye, but perhaps it’s for the best at this point,” the source added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bruno Mars with girlfriend Jessica Caban, 2015 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VuuwmblOpq</a></p>— ‎ً (@hourlyBM) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 29, 2022</a></figure><p>The Sun also mentioned that Mars’ reluctance to take his relationship with his girlfriend of 13 years to another level, aka share the wedding vows, has added more pressure on their relationship.</p><p>DeuxMoi had also hinted at the duo’s alleged forthcoming split a couple of weeks ago. An anonymous tipster had told the popular Instagram gossip account, in one of their <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18122274628323340/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&A sessions</a>, that Mars and Caban’s relationship was fizzling out.</p><p>They wrote, “Bruno Mars (ex) girlfriend not wearing any engagement ring? Could it be they split!???” To this info, DeuxMoi replied, “OMG we just talked about this on this week’s podcast episode. We could have used this info.”</p><p>The engagement in question refers to a previous report by DeuxMoi, where a source claimed that Mars and Caban had gotten engaged. The claim was agreed upon by Caban’s friend, who mentioned that Caban had been donning an engagement ring for a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Colleen-Ballinger-Broadway.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">DeuxMoi’s Instagram story where a tipster mentioned about Bruno Mars and Jessica Caban’s alleged split (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Returning to the topic, on DeuxMoi’s Q&A session on January 10, 2024, another tipster <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18007043366241705/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mentioned</a> the same thing reported by The Sun. The tipster wrote, “Bruno Mars and Jessica spent Christmas and New Year apart! Getting more obvious they split.”</p><p>As of this writing, neither Mars nor Caban has responded to the claims of their relationship fizzling out. The singer’s reps have also not made a comment. That said, Mars often likes to keep the details of his dating life away from the media.</p><p>Coming over to Mars’ relationship with his girlfriend, they first met in 2010 at a restaurant in New York. At the time, there were reports of them dating, officially confirmed via Caban’s tweet on October 7, 2012, when she shared a picture of herself and Mars.</p><p>Since then, the two have always been together, being each other’s support system. However, they did all this and more while keeping their togetherness out of the eye of the media and public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/colleen-ballinger-broadway-1.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Bruno Mars’ girlfriend Jessica Caban’s recent picture with no engagement ring amid rumored engagement news (Photo: Twitter)</p><p>Nonetheless, Mars occasionally mentioned Caban in his acceptance speeches and talked about their relationship in some of his interviews. For instance, when he won the Best Pop Vocal Album award in 2014, he said, “Jessica, I love you” onstage.</p><p>Years later, when he won the Record of the Year award in 2018, he went onstage and gushed about his life partner. He said, “My lady, Jessica, I love you, baby. Thank you for being my rock and being on my side throughout this whole process.”</p><p>Likewise, during his 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, he was asked if he would propose to Caban sometime soon. He replied that she was his best friend and they were “just happy.” His full answer read, “She’s my best friend. My rock. What’s wrong with that? We’re just happy.”</p><p>As years passed, things seemed blissful between the love birds, with one rumor claiming they were expanding their family. But these pregnancy rumors were never confirmed. And since Mars and Caban aren’t parents yet, it can be regarded as false.</p><p>Fast forward to 2024, Mars and Caban’s relationship is now in question. As mentioned earlier, reports claim they are living a separate life, hinting there might be a possible break up. For now, fans have to wait and see what happens next!</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">TikTok Couple Hunter and Devin Cordle Pregnant with Second Baby</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Devin Cordle and Hunter Cordle have been together for over six years.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DevinCordle-Pregnant.jpg alt="TikTok Couple Hunter and Devin Cordle Pregnant with Second Baby" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>American <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/tiktok/ rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> star Devin Cordle joyfully revealed the exciting news of expecting her second child with her partner, Hunter Cordle.</p><p>On January 10, 2024, Devin and Hunter captivated their followers by sharing a heartwarming video set to Billianne’s ‘Simply The Best.’ The endearing footage captured the couple in a tender moment, sharing a sweet kiss that beautifully highlighted their close and affectionate bond.</p><p>As the video unfolded, the Tiktok star affectionately revealed her growing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">baby</a> bump, complemented by a heartwarming glimpse of the ultrasound image.</p><p>Alongside the post, Hunter and Devin Cordle added a caption that playfully hinted at the timeframe, stating “Summer of 2024” with a white heart emoji.</p><p>Upon viewing the video, a wave of congratulatory messages flooded in from their friends and followers.
