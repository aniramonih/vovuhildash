[verse*Kanye West]
I know it's past visitin hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The docter don't wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anestisia
It'll send her body into a seizure
The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time?
Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon be fine</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/33/>← Prev Page</a>
