"In fact, he has been the talk of the town. Everywhere we go, people here (sic) about and want to see and hold the, 'big blue-eyed, white baby' LOL."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The family also shared a link for fans to help support them financially. In late June the couple announced their intention to move abroad for a long-term mission project.&nbsp;</p><p>"God has put a desire in our hearts to serve Him internationally for longer than the typical short-term mission trip, but we didn’t know yet how God would fulfill that desire in us," they wrote on the blog. "Earlier this year God brought about an opportunity much earlier than either of us was expecting. Several months ago a new opportunity arose for us to serve God on the mission field."</p><p>19 Kids and Counting&nbsp;was pulled from TLC in light of <strong>Josh Duggar</strong>'s molestation scandal, in which Jill had previously come forward as one of her brother's victims.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGipJxisbazxpqpZqWZqMCqu81mrKmckamybrXSq5iepF1mhm63yJ2qZpmemXqku9Snq6Kml2KworrCnqOlmaSevK95kWlobmlpbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-biel-very-rare-photos-two-sons-in-touching-tribute-to-justin-timberlake.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Biel shares never-before-seen photos of two sons in touching tribute to Justin Timberlake</span></a>
