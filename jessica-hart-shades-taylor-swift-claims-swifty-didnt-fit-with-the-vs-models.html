It looks like this year’s Victoria’s Secret was even more of a hotbed of girl-drama than I originally suspected. I thought this year’s big performer, Taylor Swift, was only going to have <a href=#>girl-drama with Cara Delevingne</a>, but it looks like Swifty managed to alienate someone completely new. Have you ever heard of a model named Jessica Hart? I’ve heard of her before, but like so many Behatis, Erins, Annes and Ninas, Jessica’s face sort of blended in with all the other models these days. Well, it seems like Jessica Hart had a problem with just the IDEA of Taylor Swift on the main stage at the Vicky’s runway show. Ouch.</p><p>Oh, snap! Lily Aldridge, Erin Heatherton, and Cara Delevingne might have been thrilled to share the runway with bestie Taylor Swift at Victoria’s Secret’s annual fashion show, but at least one lingerie model thought the singer was out of place at the event: Australian bombshell Jessica Hart.</p><p>The 27-year-old stunner shared her opinion of Swift during the show’s after-party at New York City hotspot Tao on Nov. 13. Asked by WWD if the leggy “I Knew You Were Trouble” singer could “pull it off as a Victoria’s Secret model,” Hart replied bluntly, “No.”</p><p>“I think, you know what, God bless her heart. I think she’s great,” the runway diva elaborated. “But I don’t know, to me, she didn’t fit. I don’t know if I should say that.”</p><p>Too late! So what exactly do she and the other VS models have that Swift, 23, doesn’t?</p><p>“I think what you find is that for a lot of us, we’ve been working for 14, 15 years; what it takes to make it here comes from experience and confidence and knowing how to be confident with yourself,” Hart explained. “I think it comes with age. It’s definitely the benchmark of all jobs.”</p><p>Karlie Kloss, for one, might disagree. “She and I need to be best friends!” the 21-year-old catwalker gushed to Us Weekly of Swift, who performed “I Knew You Were Trouble” during the show’s finale and boogied alongside the lingerie-clad models onstage. (She also joined Fall Out Boy during the opening sequence of the runway event.)</p><p>“I think she’s the coolest young girl,” Kloss continued. “She’s a great role model, and I love her music. It’s happening. I mean, girl power.”</p><p>Aldridge shared a similar sentiment. “We had a little moment at the end of her song ‘Trouble,’ where we walked in front of the stage together,” the 28-year-old supermodel told Us of the “Red” singer. “[Taylor] is one of my best friends, so we had so much fun.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>So, Jessica Hart is 27 years old and she’s complaining about how a 23-year-old singer (one of the most successful singers out there right now) doesn’t have the seniority, confidence or work history to be able to stand on the runway at the Victoria’s Secret show? OUCH. Good lord. You know me, I’m not a knee-jerk defender of Taylor Swift, but this Jessica Hart woman sounds like a tool. It sounds like she’s saying Swift didn’t belong on the runway because Swift isn’t a very good model. Okay, and? Taylor wasn’t there to “model” – she was there to sing! And besides that, Taylor looked like all the models – Swifty is tall, leggy, etc.</p><p>Anyway, Edward Razek, the Victoria’s Secret chief marketing officer, told Us Weekly that Jessica didn’t mean to say what she said and anyway she didn’t even say it. Or something. Razek tells Us Weekly: “I have personally been in contact with Jessica Hart and she said she was ‘wildly misinterpreted’ and that she thought Taylor was ‘amazing. She is stunned that anyone would think differently. And that’s something we can all agree on. I can tell you that everyone at Victoria’s Secret was blown away by Taylor’s performance. She could not be more beautiful or talented, that we felt extremely lucky to have her, and that she is welcome back to do the show anytime she wants… She is as good and strong and powerful and beautiful an artist as I’ve ever come across.” And on and on – <a href=#>you can read his full statement here</a>. I don’t know you guys, I think Jessica knew what she was saying and she meant it at the time and she really is just that snotty.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wenn20847476.jpg alt=wenn20847476 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wenn20847930.jpg alt=wenn20847930 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGtka311e8meqqyhk5asqa3RrZasoJGZsrSr05qwpaeilMC4tcWtlpykkZ66tKvSsKCfrKmUsaqwza2Wn6GklMSqwMeYq6Gdj6vAoLnOnZylq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-flavin-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Flavin Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
