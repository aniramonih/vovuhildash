Believe it or not, today marks 15 years since the actor starred in the silly cult classic, Bubble Boy, and we couldn’t let the anniversary go by without a little film flashback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The premise of the movie was as far-fetched as the title suggests, but Gyllenhaal brought a likability and charm to a role that would have fallen flat for practically anyone else. If you need a refresher, the star played Jimmy Livingston, an awkward but adorable guy who is essentially allergic to everything, forcing him to live life quarantined in, you guessed it, an actual bubble. But when the love of his life, Chloe, played by It Girl of the early aughts Marley Shelton, sets off to get married, Jimmy enters the real world for the first time to try to win her back and hilarity ensues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though Bubble Boy didn’t get the same (or any) critical acclaim like Gyllenhaal’s most memorable movies (Brokeback Mountain, Prisoners), there’s something captivating about seeing him show off his lighthearted side onscreen, especially so early in his career. To celebrate the film’s anniversary and the first time we fell for Gyllenhaal’s goofy grin, we’re opening up the InStyle archives and looking back on our August 2001 feature with the then-20-year-old, where he told us all about his own firsts—first car, first crush, and even first kiss. Read on to hear what the actor (seen below with Shelton at the Bubble Boy's L.A. premiere) shared about those milestones and more.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>First Job</b><br>“One summer on Martha’s Vineyard, I was a lifeguard from 9 to 5, then a bus boy and sous-chef from 5:30-12:30.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>First Car</b><br>“A 1990 maroon Volvo.
