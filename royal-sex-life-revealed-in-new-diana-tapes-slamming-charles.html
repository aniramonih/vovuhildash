Much of it comprises the princess practicing voice exercises, while at other times she is said to be “ratty and tired” and then at times she speaks very openly about her marriage.</p><p>Diana hired Settelen between 1992 and 1993 to help with her public-speaking voice, following her collaboration with author Andrew Morton on a biography, and ahead of her bombshell Panorama interview in 1995.</p><p>Ralph Lee, Channel 4’s head of factual programming, said the documentary was an “important contribution to the historical record.”</p><p>He said: “The tapes, which show a relaxed and off-duty Diana, are hugely illuminating about her personality, humor and charm.</p><p>“Combined with historical context and interviews with her closest confidants, this film provides a nuanced, multi-layered portrait of the most famous woman in the world and a mother who has shaped the future line of the royal family.</p><p>“This film gives Diana a voice and places it front and center at a time when the nation will be reflecting on her life and death.</p><p>“It is her account of events both private and public and is an important contribution to the historical record.”</p><p>Diana also talks about going to the queen to talk about Charles, saying: “I went to the top lady and I’m sobbing. And I said, ‘What do I do?’ (The queen) said, ‘I don’t know—Charles is hopeless.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfp7y6rctmqp6wXaG2p7GMq5yvnZGhsqV5yKdkp52nYrGqrc2aZK2ZoJrAbr%2FLmqSmoZ6ceqS0wKujnqs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ronan-storm-keating-romantic-secret-happy-marriage-with-five-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Ronan and Storm Keating's 'romantic' secret to happy marriage with five kids</span></a>
