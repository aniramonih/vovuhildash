Here is a look at the incident and the details about the children of the McGuires.</p><h2 id=how-many-children-did-melanie-mcguire-have-with-husband-william-mcguire>How Many Children Did Melanie McGuire Have With Husband William McGuire?</h2><p>Melanie McGuire had two children with her husband William MacGuire, aka Bill, whom she killed and packed his dismembered body in three suitcases and dumped them in the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>The story of the true incident is adapted in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>television movie</a>, Suitcase Killer: The Melanie McGuire Story which was released on June 18, 2022, on Lifetime. The series was directed by Nicole L. Thompson and stars Candice King as Melanie and Michael Roark as William.</p><p>During the time of the murder on April 28, 2004, the couple was parents to two sons and living in an apartment in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. The elder one was four years old whereas, the younger one was just two years old.</p><p>On the fateful day of the murder, Melanie first drugged her husband William and then shot him dead. After that, the ruthless woman dismembered his body and packed the hacked body parts into a 3-piece suitcase set, and dumped them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.showbizcast.com/uploads/2022/6/0e1a14c0-0ca6-4f2f-a2b2-558c3809c1e0.webp><h2 id=where-is-suitcase-killer-family-today>Where Is Suitcase Killer Family Today?</h2><p>The custody of the children of the infamous “Suitcase Killer”, Melanie McGuire was given to Bill’s sister, Cindy Ligosh. The murderer has not seen her two sons since she was arrested.</p><p>The name of the two boys was not published and no information about them was revealed to respect their privacy and prevent unwanted media attention. Apparently, the boys still live with their aunt along with their cousins.</p><p>The Suitcase Killer, Melanie McGuire gave a rare interview to ABC News’ Amy Robach in September 2020, where she continued to claim her innocence and asked her sons to dig deep into the matter and not accept what they are seeing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.showbizcast.com/uploads/2022/6/0685c166-e02a-46bc-b0c5-369ec3250bbd.webp><h2 id=why-did-melanie-mcguires-kill-her-husband-dr-bradley-miller-affair-explained>Why Did Melanie McGuires Kill Her Husband? Dr. Bradley Miller Affair Explained</h2><p>After five years of marriage, tensions built in the couple’s life when Melanie had an alleged affair with Dr. Bradley Miller. Melanie worked as a nurse in the fertility clinic where Dr. Miller was a partner. Bill used to work as a computer programmer at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.</p><p>The affair first started in 2002 when Melanie was pregnant with their second child. They were allegedly in a relationship and the friction between the married couple led the woman to take such a drastic and inhumane step.</p><p>On April 28, 2004, Melanie first drugged Bill and then shot him with a gun she brought a couple of days earlier. She then went on to dismember his body and packed it in three suitcases and dumped them, which were later found at the Chesapeake Bay in May.</p><p>Police charged Melanie with first-degree murder when clues lead to her arrest. There were a bottle of the sedative chloral hydrate and two syringes in Bill’s car which was located in Atlantic City.</p><p>Later police discovered small pieces of Bill’s flesh, “human sawdust” in Melanie’s house and concluded that she was the murderer of her husband. After a trial over the murder charge, Melanie was found guilty of first-degree murder, perjury, desecration of human remains, and possession of unlawful weapons.</p><p>On July 19, 2007, she was&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>sentenced to life</a>&nbsp;in prison with no option of parole until she is 100. Melanie still claims her innocence and denies that she murdered Bill.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHsmSdoZRiuqa4wKegnmWdmLS2tdGeZKShnKF6qbHRZp%2Buq5KWu6V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kobbie-mainoo-his-age-height-parents-position-style-of-play-stats-videos.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kobbie Mainoo, his age, height, parents, position, style of play, stats, videos</span></a>
