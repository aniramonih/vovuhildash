My friends all say they’ve never seen me so happy and the best thing they ever say is, ‘Don’t you screw this up!’ And I promise that I won’t,” Jones said about her union to the Chicago lawyer. “He’s a wonderful man, he’s kind and gentle.”</p><p>The Star Jones Show alum also dished on her new role as a mom. Through her marriage to Lugo, she is now stepmother to his son, Jake.</p><p>“[Lugo] has given me the greatest <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> there ever is — motherhood. I have a 14-year-old son [Jake]. It’s the best,” she explained. “I’ve got news for you. I am that mother. I am there at high school. He’s a new high schooler, he’s in ninth grade, but I feel like a shrimp in my family. Jake’s 14 and 6 [feet] 2 [inches tall] but I’m very, very happy.”</p><p>Jones and Lugo exchanged vows on a cruise ship in the Bahamas on March 25, 2018. The Celebrity Apprentice alum has previously been tight-lipped about her romance with the attorney. She confirmed <a href=#>her engagement</a> to Us in October 2017 but wouldn’t share any details about her wedding plans.</p><p>“We’re engaged. Not talking about it,” she laughingly told&nbsp;Us at the time. “He’s wonderful. I’m happy and that’s all anybody outside of my family needs to know.”</p><p>Two days before walking down the aisle, Jones gave fans a peek into her almost married bliss with a behind-the-scenes Instagram video.</p><p>“You know you’re really happy when your kid says at lunch, ‘Stop smiling. You’re going to break your face,’” she teased in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>. “This is the happiest weekend of my entire life. Oh yeah.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jones and Lugo first made headlines when they arrived together at the&nbsp;Children’s Museum of the East End Family Affair in July 2016. Jones was previously married to lawyer <strong>Al Reynolds</strong> from 2004 to 2008.</p><p>With reporting by Nicki Gostin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJGnequ7zZ6qZquRrsBuv8eeqmarn2K1orzPsmSsoZ6Ysm65wKupsqGenHqztcKaqZ2nXaHCqLuO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shoichiro-toyoda-biography-age-height-quotes-family-health-death.html><span>←</span><span>Shoichiro Toyoda Biography, Age, Height, Quotes, Family, Health, Death</span></a>
