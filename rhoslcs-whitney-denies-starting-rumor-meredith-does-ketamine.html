(Jen, 59, won’t be featured on season 4 as she <a href=#>serves her 66-month sentence</a> for conspiracy to commit wire fraud.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Whitney-Rose-to-Meredith-Marks-I-Swear-It-s-Not-My-Fault-People-Think-You-Take-Ketamine-333.jpg><p>“No, it was a dig on my marriage and a dig on my bath habit,” Meredith replies. “Like, [you implied] I have a dirty house.”</p><p>In a confessional interview, Whitney claims she would “never assume that Meredith has a dirty house,” but she couldn’t resist noting that she doesn’t even know “what vacation rental” Meredith is staying in at the moment. (<a href=#><strong>Lisa Barlow</strong></a> famously claimed during her iconic season 2 hot mic rant that Meredith and her husband, <strong>Seth Marks</strong>, don’t own a home because Seth “changes jobs every five minutes.”)</p><p>The conversation then devolved into a discussion of whether Meredith and Whitney keep their bathtubs clean. “Meredith, I take baths all the time,” Whitney declares. “But I prefer to take my baths alone, which is true. Why are you judging me for wanting to take a bath alone?”</p><p>In a confessional segment, Whitney adds, “It is my right to prefer to take a bathtub [sic] alone.” She’s not wrong! That’s definitely in the Utah state constitution, right under “no polygamy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Alas, the bathtub tension was not resolved in these 90 seconds, but the good news is that RHOSLC returns in less than one week. Please spend your Labor Day weekend sending appropriate offerings of thanks to <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>.</p><p>Season 4 of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City premieres on Bravo Tuesday, September 5, at 9 p.m. ET. Episodes will be available to stream the next day via Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp6OhsLR51qGgraaVrnqlsc2inKxlo6mus8DIp55mqqWivLN5zJ6pnpyZqbVusM6eqmajlamurrXNnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reservation-dogs-who-is-actress-elva-guerra-everything-on-her-age-and-wikipedia.html><span>←</span><span>Reservation Dogs: Who Is Actress Elva Guerra?
