We will continue to pray for her health and to see her doing fine.‚Äù</p><p>The 75-year-old artist was not only the first Korean to win an Oscar, but she was also the first Korean actor to get the Screen Actors Guild Award and the British Academy Film Award. She was most recently seen in the television version of the book Pachinko, where she co-starred in with actor Lee Min-ho.&nbsp;However, she is not the only artist who has departed the agency. Lee Seung-gi, a singer-actor, recently announced his departure from Hook Entertainment after 18 years.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Youn-Yuh-Jung.jpg alt="Youn Yuh Jung" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 35-year-old accused the agency of failing to pay the fees and revenues for his songs‚Äô digital streaming. Since joining them in 2004, the vocalist has recorded 137 songs, including singles such as Because You‚Äôre My Woman and Will You Marry Me.&nbsp;The artist was ridiculed or intimidated every time he requested a transparent settlement of his expenses, according to his attorneys. The agency said in a statement:</p><p>‚ÄúLee Seung-gi has concluded that he can no longer rely on Hook Entertainment and its CEO, Kwon Jin-young, whom he has treated as family.‚Äù</p><h2>Outrage among netizens after Dispatch exposes CEO Kwon</h2><p>Hook Entertainment CEO Kwon allegedly apologized for the Lee Seung-gi incident and confirmed that payments were owed. While the sum was not specified, the CEO went on to say that she would be prepared to sell her personal assets to pay the bills.&nbsp;Her apology was received with strong condemnation from netizens when Dispatch published audio recordings of her threatening to murder Lee Seung-gi and detailed details of her squandering business finances. Fans dubbed it a ‚Äúfalse apology,‚Äù and demanded that she be properly probed and punished not just for failing to make the money, but also for subjecting Seung-gi to years of emotional torture.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Youn-Yuh-Jung-2.jpg alt="Youn Yuh Jung" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In November, the National Police Agency‚Äôs Severe Crime Investigation Division seized and searched the firm on suspicion of embezzlement.&nbsp;The agency continues to represent Park Min-young from What‚Äôs Wrong With Secretary Kim, Lee So-jin from Marriage Contract, and Lee Sun-hee from Korea‚Äôs National Diva.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiwqK2eYsa2tIyjrKefXZZ6sL%2FCmqlmr5mju6q6xmaYnKyimsC0eceaqmaklZvBbsDHnmShp5%2Bgeqa6056prZmZo7qmutNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-1780-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Yasmeen Ghauri Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family</span></a>
