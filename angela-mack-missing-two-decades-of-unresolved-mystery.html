around the disappearance of 20-year-old Angela Mack Cox and her son, Thomas “Mikey” Rettew, in September 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>The mother-son duo’s last sighting was in a late-model dark gray or blue

Mikey were last spotted in Salem, Arkansas, departing in a late-model dark gray or blue Chevrolet or GMC extended cab pickup truck with Missouri license plates.&nbsp;</p><p>The chilling fact about their disappearance is that they seemed to have vanished without a trace, leaving no tangible clues or leads for investigators to follow.</p><p>Despite the exhaustive efforts of law enforcement agencies, the absence of concrete evidence presented a formidable challenge in making significant progress in the case.</p><p>Numerous dead-ends and misleading leads emerged, further shrouding the mystery surrounding their abrupt disappearance.</p><p>The absence of Angela and Mikey left a gaping hole in the lives of their family and friends, who waited anxiously for any <a href=#>news</a> of their whereabouts.&nbsp;</p><p>As years turned into decades, hope began to wane, but the search for Angela and Mikey never ceased.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Investigation into Angela Mack Missing case</h2><p>A recent update on the Angela Mack Missing case suggests that the cold issue has finally been solved.&nbsp;</p><p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) contacted the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office (FCSO) with a potential lead in the case in August 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the FCSO Investigator Dale Weaver has been interviewing several people who knew Mack-Cox to gather more facts about her disappearance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Thomas Michael review</h2><p>Thomas Michael “Mikey” Rettew’s disappearance has been a part of the case from the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>He was reported missing by his father, and the last time he was seen with his mother was on September 1, 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent information suggested that Angela left Mikey with a couple in Alton, Missouri, intending to have them adopt him.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after being in California for some time, she decided to back out of the adoption and was supposed to return to Alton to get her son, but she never showed up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Angela Mack Cox</h2><p>Not much is known about Angela Mack Cox’s life apart from the fact that she was only 20 years old when she went missing.&nbsp;</p><p>She had two sons, Thomas “Mikey” Rettew, who was four years old then, and a two-year-old son, who was left behind when she disappeared.</p><p>&nbsp;Angela and her

recent development has shed light on their disappearance, and investigators are one step closer to finding answers.</p><p>On April 7, 2021, veteran Fulton County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Dale Weaver broke the news to Angela’s father and brother.</p><p>A person had confessed to what had happened to Angela and her son.</p><p>While the FBI has not disclosed any further details, it is apparent that progress has been made in cracking this case wide open.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where is Angela or her son Mikey Rettew now?</h2><p>To date, there is no information regarding the whereabouts of Angela Mack-Cox or her son, Mikey Rettew.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, investigating their disappearance continues, with authorities diligently pursuing new leads and information.</p><p>According to reports, Angela entrusted Mikey to a couple residing in Alton, Missouri, in the autumn of 2002, with the intention of them adopting him.</p><p>After leaving Mikey with the couple, Angela went to California.&nbsp;</p><p>However, her intentions shifted, and she wanted to withdraw from the adoption process. Consequently, she was advised to return to Alton to retrieve her son.</p><p>Subsequently, she was collected from the bus station in Springfield, Missouri, by one of the individuals connected to the situation and taken to where her son, Mikey, lived.&nbsp;</p><p>Regrettably, no one has seen her since, raising concerns about her safety and location.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Have investigators arrested the suspect?</h2><p>Though no arrests have been made at this point.</p><p>A recent confession from people concerning Angela Mack and her son’s disappearance case holds promising potential for significant developments in the investigation.</p><p>There remains to be more information concerning the whereabouts of the individual implicated in the confession.</p><p>However, his investigation is still underway, and authorities maintain an optimistic outlook with hopes of known additional leads that could ultimately result in the suspect’s arrest.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCtzaCcpZldoq6kt4ymoKyrmaO0bsDWqGSdnZOWsaa%2FjKidZq2ep7K0u8uvnJ1lna7AtbHRsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andy-lassner-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Andy Lassner Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
