I say that because of the strangely hostile tone of the video, which is focused as much on the scrutiny Mayweather says he gets from the media as it is on the timepieces themselves. Here's Floyd:</p><p><strong>"You know what's crazy, people are always in my f—king business worried about what I'm doing. What Floyd is doing, what Floyd ain't doing. What I do got, what I don't got. Just know, Imma stay in my lane, I don't f—k with nobody, and I don't want nobody f—kin' with me."</strong></p><p>He goes on to reveal the practical purpose of having a collection of so many watches. It's so when he goes on an extended "paycation," he can have a different watch for every day of his trip, stored in a stylish collection of two specially padded suitcases, each one filled with 15 watches, with a third case for spillover. As he explains:</p><p><strong>"Now if I go on vacation, my fault, when I go on paycation for 30 days, I take 30 watches with me… But you know what, what's crazy is this: If we add 10 more days, I take 10 more watches. But then I say, 'f—k it,' if I want to bring out the one and only, then I bring out the watch that costs $18 million."</strong></p><p>That would be "The Billionaire's Watch" by Jacob & Co. in 2015, and which Mayweather did indeed <a href=#>pay $18 million for last year</a>. The watch sports 239 emerald-cut baguette diamond up to three carats each, and is in a manner of speaking the jewel of his watch collection.</p><p>In the summer of 2017, Mayweather also showed off his watch collection, claiming that one case came to $6.4 million. You can check out the more recent showcase of his watch collection below:</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@mayweatherpromotions @girlcollection @themoneygirls @bigboymansion #mayweather #TMT #TBE</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Floyd Mayweather</a> (@floydmayweather) on Jan 9, 2019 at 3:14pm PST</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCyy6iwnWWdlsa4scCtn56qXai1sMPSZqafnl2dtrR5xLGrnqajnsOmedaaq5ygXZi8rbjEnKuip55ivK95yKeqrZmXp66uew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-mendes-skips-red-carpet-supports-ryan-gosling-oscars-backstage.html><span>←</span><span>Eva Mendes skips red carpet to support Ryan Gosling at Oscars see intimate glimpse</span></a>
