He passed away on 1 August 2023. But the question is that how did he die? Was he suffering from any type of illness?</span></p><p><span>The answer is yes. He was suffering from a prolonged undisclosed illness. David’s older brother Dan Le Batard revealed his death.</span></p><p><span>David passed away at the age of 50. He got diagnosed with an illness about a year ago but he never revealed his illness in the media. His brother said,</span></p><p><span>“my best friend for over 50 years,” as “inconceivable.”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t have a lot of experience with grief, but I had been grieving him for a year,” he said during his podcast. “Because when he was diagnosed more than a year ago, he’s been steadily deteriorating since. And it’s been brutally, brutally hard to watch a poison eat him up from the inside and one of the biggest spirits I’ve ever seen consumed by illness.”</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>We’re Live ❤️</p><p>📺 <a href=#>https://t.co/6IwClttgOL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0pIaSXllIn</a></p><p>— Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz (@LeBatardShow) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 1, 2023</a></p><p><span>David Le Batard was born on 19 November 1972 in New York City to Cuban immigrant parents (Gonzalo and Lourdes Le Batard).
