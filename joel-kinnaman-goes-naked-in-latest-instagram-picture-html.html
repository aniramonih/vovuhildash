The actor stretched his leg to the camera instead of shielding his private portion with his body, while he grinned cheekily, showing off his arm tattoo and chiseled stomach. Due to the community rules of the social networking platform, though, he concealed his cock with a pink heart emoji.<br>In the caption, Joel wrote, “A wise man told me it’s every mans right to be naked in his own home. Unfortunately this isn’t my home.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The comment section was quickly filled with very thirsty messages from people, when many requested that he delete the emoji protecting his private region. “Remove the heart!! Lol,” one said as another echoed the feeling, “Please remove the heart. Thank you.” One other noted, “We need the (heart emoji) off the picture right now.”</p><p>“I just threw up in my Mouth,” to which one fan responded, “New bucket list item/episode for ya ‘Nekkid in a hot tub with Joel.’ ” Somebody else gushed, “This makes my heart beat so fast I just wish it was fast enough too (sic) knock that heart off there well a girl can dream.” Will Smith also entered the fun by adding a teasing shade.</p><p>Joel is better remembered for his appearances as Detective Stephen on “The Killing” Takeshi Kovacs in the first season of “Altered Carbon” and Governor Will Conway on “House of Cards” at the outset of his acting career in the 1990s. He also starred in the remake of “RoboCop” in 2014 and played in “Suicide Squad” with Rick Flag.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>15</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxxfY6jpp6kXaC2r7rAppinZZeksrR5zZqinpxdnrtuuMCtnKysXZ67tMDAoKmapV2ltqTA1KucZ6Ckork%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-garner-gets-real-about-body-changes-since-having-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Garner Gets Real About Body Changes Since Having Kids</span></a>
