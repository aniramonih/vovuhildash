The practice was meant to denote ownership of livestock, and switched from an original, earlier form of marking (possibly paint) to the metal-on-hide method by at least 2000 BCE. The word "brand" derives from Old Norse, itself based on the Proto-Germanic brandaz&nbsp;("a burning"), as stated on <a href=#>Etymonline</a>. It took all the way until the 1600s for the word to become synonymous with marking cattle.</p><p>The concept of "branding," however, was never limited only to cattle. Pottery from modern-day China, India, Greece, Rome, and Iraq was engraved with symbols to indicate their maker, and even material. Bricks themselves, including those used in the Great Pyramids, were etched with quarry marks going back even further, to 4000 BCE. Medieval guilds used watermarks to distinguish their own paper, and the famed Renaissance painter Michelangelo started the whole "signing my name on things" form of branding.</p><p>Of course, this is way, way before we started seeing that swirly <a href=#>Coca-Cola</a> logo slashed across the plastic label of the nation's trademark phosphoric acid-filled soft drink. With the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s came the need for mass-market branding, as society was suddenly flooded with goods, and logos became a shorthand description for customer expectation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bl3Jpa29fl7%2BiusOipaBlpJ2ybsDRrquhZZGXvLbAjJyYraycmnqtu8aoqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-aoki-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Aoki Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
