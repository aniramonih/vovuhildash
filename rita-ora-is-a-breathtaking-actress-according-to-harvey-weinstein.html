Of course Rita would pap walk as a pretty-pink princess, but I can’t figure out if she’s dressed as a Barbie or Paris Hilton. Both seem possible. Rita actually had an embarrassing Halloween experience. She bit from the cruel-apple mistress named Twitter and overplayed her hand. Rita <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “Dropping my new song Monday if this gets 100,000 retweets.” Such chutzpah is admirable, but Rita received less than 2000 RTs. Mega-ouch:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ritatweet.jpg alt="Rita Ora" width=460 sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Of course Rita deleted the tweet and <a href=#>said someone hacked her account</a>. She was super happy that she <a href=#>caught the post quickly</a>. I guess we’re supposed to wonder if Rita made up the hacking story to save face or if <a href=#>Calvin Harris worked in mysterious ways</a> again.</p><p>Rita will be fine. She’ll work out this music thing. Maybe? If she doesn’t, there’s always acting. Harvey Weinstein says she’s his “biggest discovery” of the year. Oh, rly?</p><p>Brit singer Rita Ora has jetted into LA for talks with movie bosses amid buzz over her role in Fifty Shades of Grey.</p><p>The blonde star, 23, plays Christian Grey’s little sister Mia Grey in the movie based on E.L. James’ hit trilogy.</p><p>Fifty Shades is released in February and the How We Do singer has also impressed “Mr Oscar” himself, movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who hired her for his new film, Southpaw, starring Jake Gyllenhaal.</p><p>Mr Weinstein called Rita “breathtaking,” telling MailOnline she is his “biggest discovery” as an actress this year.</p><p>He said: “Rita Ora did a sensational job for me and Antoine Fuqua in Southpaw. Her scene is breathtaking, because she’s a very glamorous, beautiful woman; but, we did the opposite, we made her up to look like a tough junkie who’s got a kid to protect.</p><p>‘She is heart-breakingly real and wonderful and acting opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, who is riveting in this movie, she holds her own and then some. I will work with Rita again and again and again. Personally, I thinks she’s my biggest discovery as an actress this year.’</p><p>Southpaw stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a boxer trying to make a comeback, while at the same time putting his personal life back in order. The film features other A-list names including Rachel McAdams and Forest Whitaker, and comes out next year.</p><p>A source revealed that Rita is also in talks for another high-profile role starring a huge name.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>]</p><p>Harvey says Rita is his “biggest discovery” this year? Man, <a href=#>Suki Waterhouse just got the shaft</a> (although she may have won that title last year). Believe it or not, I didn’t decide to write about this story to make fun of Rita (or Suki). This is all about Harvey, Mr. Notorious, who has championed a stream of actresses who didn’t go far beyond his praises. I assume Harvey wants Rita to wear Marchesa? Yeah, that’s it. I see right through you, Harvey.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wenn21588356.jpg alt="Harvey Weinstein" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Here’s a photo of Rita performing after switching Christmas lights on at a London shopping center.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wenn21887593.jpg alt="Rita Ora" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet & WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbHFmZ390e9Giq5qXn6euoLXSmJiYmqKarrW005qioqaXlK6kwNGeqqyXkZiwsL7DoqWgl6SkrKmt0a%2Bcspenmravv9OeoKdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reshma-dordi-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Reshma Dordi Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
