However, Lee found herself doing a lot of other projects after she retired from the squared circle. After writing comics, producing wrestling matches, and acting in a few series and movies, the 36-year-old is now working on the second season of Heels. The WWE Universe went berserk as soon as they got a glimpse of AJ Lee in the trailer.</p><p>AJ Lee quickly became popular with the fans following her debut on the main roster in 2011. She made it clear that she was not like the other divas of the time and demanded that everyone treat her like a legit superstar. Lee was one of the most popular Divas Champions in the history of the title. Her feud with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paige</a> is regarded as one of the best feuds in both women’s careers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>After the latest trailer of “Heels” was recently released, fans got a glimpse of the new characters that will appear on the show. Among the new characters, a prominent face is, AJ Lee who plays Elle Dorado in the show. In the trailer, Lee is seen putting her opponent in the Black Widow maneuver, which was her submission in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The show stars Stephen Amell, Alexander Ludwig, and Alison Luff. Multiple stars, like David James Elliott and Robby Ramos, are also recurring in the show and will play various roles. The show is famous among wrestling fans for multiple reasons. One of them is that Lee’s husband and one of the biggest stars in the wrestling industry, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk</a>, makes a recurring appearance on the show.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“More jacked than CM”- Wrestling Twitter go bananas over AJ Lee’s shredded physique, speculation running rampant regarding her wrestling comeback</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-aj-lee-s-cameo-in-heels-season-2>Fans react to AJ Lee’s cameo in Heels season 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1688127076907.jpg><p>Since the release of the trailer, fans have been reacting online to the appearance of the former Divas Champion.
