Then chaos erupted.</p><p>Bryan Alvarez was sent a list of actual charges that the three women in the WrestleMania main event would face if this didn’t happen within the confines of WWE. He read them during<a href=#> Wrestling Observer Live</a> and there is quite a laundry list of charges.</p><p>“Becky would face 3 counts of assault and resisting arrest. Charlotte would face 9 counts of assault, 5 counts of assaulting an officer, and 4 counts of resisting arrest. Ronda would face 3 counts of assault, 5 counts of assaulting an officer, 2 counts of resisting arrest, misdemeanor vandalism, grand theft, and assault with a deadly weapon.”</p><p>Surprisingly, all three women are <a href=#>now free with court dates set</a>. It’s very likely that if you tried to pull off even a fraction of what happened on Monday that you would be facing a lot of time in the slammer.</p><p>This is more proof that WWE needs to start airing those “don’t try this at home” commercials before their shows again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>If you use our quotes credit <a href=#>Ringside News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49tZmlqX5awtcHApWScoJGntKa%2FjKump5yRYr%2BwwdKesGaalZi4unnLsqWcoF2YtaK%2By6irrZ1dm7mitdFmrqitnJl6p63CnmSanqSav26t0aucrKyjYryvedawnGaqkax8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khalilah-ali.html><span>←</span><span>Actress, Khalilah Ali Who Famous As Former Wife Of Muhammad Ali Is Currently Single.</span></a>
