The duo reconnected years later after her <a href=#>72-day marriage</a> to <a href=#><strong>Kris Humphries</strong></a> ended. At the time, Kardashian visited Paris to attend West’s fashion show.</p><p>“Right before I got married to Kris Humphries, [Kanye and I] were talking and I just went a different direction. I think I had to go through that to figure out what I wanted,” she explained on the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> 10th anniversary special in 2017. “After my breakup, I was feeling really low and down and he said, ‘Just come to Paris and see my fashion show.’”</p><p>The businesswoman added, “He jokes that he put on this whole fashion show just to get a date with me. So, I went there and I stayed with him, and that’s where we started dating. I swear from the moment I landed, I fell madly in love with him and I thought, ‘Oh, my God. Why didn’t I do this sooner?’ Like, this is what real life is like — love and fun and real support.”</p><p>The twosome began dating in the spring of 2012 and Us Weekly confirmed that December that Kardashian was expecting the pair’s first child, <a href=#>North</a>. Four months <a href=#>after welcoming North</a>, the “Gold Digger” rapper proposed to Kardashian. The couple wed in Italy in May 2014.</p><p>As their marriage progressed, the pair <a href=#>encountered issues when trying to grow their family</a>. Though Kardashian gave birth to son <a href=#>Saint</a> in 2015, she would welcome daughter <a href=#>Chicago</a> in 2018 and son <a href=#>Psalm</a> in 2019 via surrogate.</p><p>“You get your surrogate attorney, you get your surrogate broker and then the broker recommended that we use a therapist that would communicate with me first and then communicate with her and kind of be our liaison,” she explained on <strong>Laura Wasser</strong>’s <a href=#>“All’s Fair” podcast</a> in February 2020. “Toward the end, we got close enough where we could communicate really without that.”</p><p>The pair continued to encounter and overcome hardships over the years, including <a href=#>Kardashian being held at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room in 2016</a>. West abruptly ended his New York concert and rushed to his wife’s side upon hearing of the scary incident.</p><p>In July 2020, the Grammy winner <a href=#>announced his run for the U.S. presidency</a>. During <a href=#>his campaign rally in South Carolina</a>, he revealed a very personal tidbit about <a href=#>how he and Kardashian considered aborting their daughter North</a>. He then proceeded to go on a Twitter rant, during which he claimed that <a href=#>Kardashian tried to get a “doctor to lock me up”</a> after his behavior at the South Carolina event.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After months of split rumors, <a href=#>Kardashian filed for divorce from West</a> in February 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to see Kardashian and West’s ups and downs through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mopqmqZp6uLHSrapmraCoeqK6w2abqK%2BeqHq1tNGorKCgXam1pnnYnpirq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-clifton.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Clifton:Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos from the Strictly Dancer- HELLO!</span></a>
