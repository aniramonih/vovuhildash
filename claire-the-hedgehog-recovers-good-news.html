The prickly young lady was brought into the Wildlife Orphanage and Hedgehog Hospital in North Yorkshire by a member of the public, who had discovered Claire lying outside in the daytime, supposedly snoring. In a dramatic turn of events, the hospital staff quickly realised that Claire was actually suffering from a potentially fatal case of pneumonia and lungworm. "We didn't think she'd make it to be honest," explained Annette Pyrah, who runs the centre.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:center id=e-FpVvM8r4Yq data-wc=9><strong>VIDEO:&nbsp;Good News: The Story Of Claire The Hedgehog</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ehuyHW13vDnq data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>7 Charities you can support during coronavirus and how to help</a></strong></p><p id=ePZysJd3wmhF data-wc=99>Since revealing the details of her miracle recovery, Annette has now confirmed that as of Wednesday, Claire is one healthy hedgehog. "We have lots of equipment here, a nebuliser, an intensive care unit and we have a vet who can dispense the medicines needed and it's been a long time," she said, "but on Wednesday morning we had some really good news.&nbsp; Never in a million years did I think Claire would reach this point but she did - she now breathes totally silently. And she's put on a lot of weight. Just look at those chubby little thighs!"</p><p id=es-YE76cUc29 data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Bob in Connecticut couldn't visit his wife in her care home so he made a sign and stood outside&nbsp;instead</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/59c3df6ce9be-claire-the-hedgehog-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eeviMnMn1OI7 data-wc=11><strong>Claire the hedgehog has been in intensive care for three weeks</strong></p><p id=eFyNivupv9FS data-wc=112>An adorable video of the gorgeous hedgehog shows her breathing peacefully as she indulges in a mid-morning nap - and we can't stop crying. Clearly thriving since receiving treatment at the wildlife hospital, Annette was more than thrilled to reveal the good news: "We're absolutely delighted. Miracles do happen," she said. "When you consider how she was when she first came in it was horrible to hear and see her struggling like she was - isn't she just gorgeous!" Explaining that the next step would be for Claire to venture outside in a pre-release pen, we're sending all our love and well wishes to Claire - the hedgehog who overcame incredible odds.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiF9rbzYiYcQ data-wc=27>If you want to find out how you can help out the wonderful staff at the Wildlife Orphanage & Hedgehog Hospital in North Yorkshire, head to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>wildlifeorphans.co.uk</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eF1xUAJY6_Gn data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>High-street brand Joules will plant one tree for every pair of wellies bought</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfo7K4v45rZ2toYGh%2BeoSVbnBpZ5Ohrqq%2BxGaroZ1dnbKls8ShpqBlopqwsMLEq6pmn5%2BksW66xLCqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gerald-mcclellan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-604350-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gerald Mcclellan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
