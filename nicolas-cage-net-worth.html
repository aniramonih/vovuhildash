Nicolas Cage's net worth at one time much higher, easily over $100 million, after earning at least $200 million from movie salaries alone. Nick's profligate spending is somewhat infamous today. Despite being one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood, Nicolas Cage got himself into some serious financial straits resulting from both his failure to pay his taxes and some bad real estate investments that left Cage in a position where he had to sell not only his Ferrari Enzo but other prized possessions as well. These possessions most famously included his copy of Action Comics #1 (one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>most valuable comic books in existence</a>), which he sold at auction for a record-breaking $2.16 million. We detail his years-long impressively wild spending spree later in this article.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Nicolas Cage was born Nicolas Kim Coppola on January 7, 1964 in Long Beach, California. His father August Coppola was a professor of literature and his mother Joy Vogelsang was a dancer and choreographer. August passed away from a heart attack in 2009. Cage has two brothers and attended Beverly Hills High School and UCLA's School of Theatre. Through his father, Cage is the nephew of director <a href=#><strong>Francis Ford Coppola</strong></a> and actress <a href=# title="Talia Shire Net Worth">Talia Shire</a>, and the cousin of directors <a href=# title="Sofia Coppola Net Worth">Sofia Coppola</a> and <a href=# title="Roman Coppola Net Worth">Roman Coppola</a>, and actor <a href=# title="Jason Schwartzman Net Worth">Jason Schwartzman</a>. To avoid the appearance of nepotism, Cage changed his last name, which was inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-235102 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cage.jpg alt width=594 height=408 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-235102 class=wp-caption-text>Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images</p><h2 id=acting-career><strong>Acting Career</strong></h2><p>Cage landed his first film role in 1982's "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" and from that time worked steadily throughout the '80s and early nineties in such popular films as "Valley Girl", "Raising Arizona", "Peggy Sue Got Married", "Honeymoon in Vegas", "Face/Off", "Con Air", "Gone in Sixty Seconds", "<a href=# title="The Rock Net Worth">The Rock</a>", and "The Family Man"; just to name a few of his more than 70 film credits to date. His second-highest-grossing film to date was National Treasure in 2004. Despite his success in many of these big-budget action films, most of his lower-profile movies have been box office letdowns compared to his action/adventure mainstream flicks, which tend to be enormous successes. His 2006 remake of Wicker Man failed to make back its $40 million budget and opened to overwhelmingly negative reviews.</p><p>In 2007, Cage was spotted a wrestling show researching for the lead role of <a href=# title="Darren Aronofsky Net Worth">Darren Aronofsky</a>'s The Wrestler. However, he later dropped out of the running for the part. <a href=# title="Mickey Rourke Net Worth">Mickey Rourke</a> went on to receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance in the lead role. In 2009, Cage starred in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, directed by <a href=# title="Werner Herzog Net Worth">Werner Herzog</a>. The film received universally positive reviews, and Cage was lauded for his lead role. He hit box office success in 2012 with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, which grossed $585 million. His next film, Joe, was a box office flop. In 2018, he starred in <a href=# title="Elijah Wood Net Worth">Elijah Wood</a>-produced Mandy, an action thriller which received much critical praise. Wood intended to drum up Oscar support for Cage but ultimately the film was disqualified for a late-in-the-year release. Cage signed up to play the lead role in Richard Stanley's 2018 film Color Out of Space. It was Stanley's first feature film since 1996.</p><p>Nicolas Cage went on to star in 2021's Pig, 2022's The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and 2023's Renfield. Also in 2023, Cage donned the cape of Superman in a cameo in The Flash as an alternate version of the superhero.</p><h2 id=financial-problems-recovery><strong>Financial Problems and Recovery</strong></h2><p>Between 1996 and 2011 alone, Nick earned more than <strong>$150 million</strong> from acting salaries. He earned $16 million for Snake Eyes, $20 million for Gone in Sixty Seconds, $20 million for Windtalkers, $20 million for National Treasure… just to name a few. Not surprisingly, as his income went up so did his spending habits. Actually, to be fair, as his income increased Nick's spending habits <strong>SKYROCKETED</strong>. Between 2000 and 2007 Nick went on a spending spree that would make the <a href=# title="Sultan of Brunei Net Worth">Sultan of Brunei</a> blush. His purchases included 15 personal homes (including TWO castles), a $7 million private island in the Bahamas, four luxury yachts, a fleet of exotic cars, a $30 million private jet, dozens of pieces of art, jewels and a 67 million-year-old dinosaur skull.</p><p>In 2009, the IRS filed a federal tax lien on a property Cage owned in New Orleans. It was alleged that Cage had failed to pay over $6.2 million in federal income taxes. Cage subsequently filed a $20 million lawsuit against his business manager, accusing him of negligence and fraud. By 2022, Cage confirmed he had finally paid off his debts and intended to be more selective with film roles after accepting anything and everything in order to build up the money needed.</p><h2 id=other-ventures><strong>Other Ventures</strong></h2><p>Cage made his directorial debut in Sonny (2002). He has produced Shadow of the Vampire and The Dresden Files.</p><p>Cage has done voice work for Teen Titans Go! To The Movies, as well as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Universe. He was the narrator of the 2019 film Love, Antosha, a documentary made by Viktor and Irina Yelchin about their late son <a href=# title="Anton Yelchin Net Worth">Anton Yelchin</a>.</p><p>An avid comic book fan, in 2002 Cage auctioned a collection of 400 vintage comics for over $1.6 million. He created a comic book with his son Weston called Voodoo Child in 2007. Cage collects works by underground comic artist Robert Williams.</p><p>Cage is set to make his video game debut in July 2023 as himself in Dead by Daylight.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295685 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Nicolas-Cage-1.jpg alt="Richest Actors" width=900 height=610 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295685 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=accolades><strong>Accolades</strong></h2><p>Nicolas Cage won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his starring role in the film "Leaving Las Vegas" in 1996.
