"When I was a kid before we had hair products, we used to brush my hair out. Finally they started making products for curly hair," she said. "You gotta get someone who knows how to cut curly hair. If you get too much razor on it, it splits the ends and goes crazy on you," she added. "Or if someone cuts it too short, what people don't understand about curly hair is, when its wet, it's longer, and when you cut it wet it shrinks way, way up. The cut is hugely important along with the products."</p><p dir=ltr>Schlapman's products won't break the bank and most of them can be found in your local drugstore. Schlapman has "used a lot of different things," but her favorite products include Frizz-Ease and Moroccan Oil and Rusk's Wired Flexible Styling Creme. You will have to go to a salon to get your hands on the more expensive Indian Gooseberry Oil, however, per <a href=#>Naturally Curly</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Brushing curly hair is no easy feat, either, according to the 51-year-old singer. "The only time I ever brush my hair is when it's wet, never brush it dry," she said. She also loves Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream. Air drying her hair "takes forever," so she likes to alternate with a diffuser. Her message to curly haired girls is simple: "Embrace the curls!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHFhboR4e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2gtq6uxKujsmWjmLWtrc%2BmmKerXZ2uqr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-if-there-was-a-man-by-pretenders.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: If There Was a Man by Pretenders</span></a>
