However, it was his 2005 album, “It’s Time,” and his 2007 album, “Call Me Irresponsible,” that catapulted him to international stardom.</p><p>These albums topped charts not only in Canada but also in the UK, the US, Australia, and several European countries. His 2009 album, “Crazy Love,” debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and remained there for two weeks, solidifying his position as a prominent artist. Bublé’s 2011 holiday album, “Christmas,” also reached number one on the Billboard 200 and became his third consecutive chart-topping album.</p><p>With over 75 million records sold worldwide, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bublé </a>has achieved remarkable commercial success and garnered numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards and fifteen Juno Awards.</p><p>Michael Bublé’s musical influences and passion for singing developed at a young age. He has credited his interest in jazz to his family playing Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas” album when he was just five years old. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin, and Sam Cooke are among the artists who have shaped his musical style and taste.</p><p>From an early age, Michael Bublé showed remarkable singing talent, and his family first noticed his powerful voice during a car ride when he was 13 years old. While singing along to the song “White Christmas,” he belted out the phrase “May your days be merry and bright,” leaving his family impressed by his vocal prowess.</p><p>In addition to his musical pursuits, Bublé had a strong passion for ice hockey and dreamt of becoming a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks. Although he ultimately pursued a career in music, his love for hockey remains evident. As a dedicated fan, he co-owns the Vancouver Giants, a major junior ice hockey team, and requires a local team hockey puck in his dressing room as part of his concert contract in every city he performs.</p><p>Bublé’s philanthropic endeavors have also been notable. In 2009, he pledged a donation of A$50,000 to support the victims of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, Australia. Furthermore, in 2019, he renovated his late grandfather’s Vancouver home and generously gifted it to his caretaker as a heartfelt gesture.</p><p>Throughout his career, Bublé has touched the hearts of millions with his enchanting voice and timeless music. His journey from local talent contests to international acclaim is a testament to his unwavering dedication and passion for his craft. With his undeniable talent, charismatic personality, and genuine love for music, Michael Bublé continues to captivate audiences worldwide.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Bublé Wife: Meet Luisana Lopilato</h2><p>Previously, Bublé was engaged to actress Debbie Timuss, with whom he appeared in the musicals “Red Rock Diner” in 1996 and “Dean Regan’s Forever Swing” in 1998. Timuss was even featured in Bublé’s self-titled album and “It’s Time,” providing background vocals and serving as one of the dedicatees. During their time together, Bublé co-wrote the hit single “Home” for Timuss, which became a significant milestone in their relationship. The engagement, however, came to an end in November 2005, inspiring Bublé to write the song “Lost.”</p><p>In 2005, while attending Australia’s Logie Awards, Bublé crossed paths with English actress Emily Blunt, and the two began dating shortly after. Blunt lent her vocals to Bublé’s tracks “Me and Mrs. Jones,” and he even penned the song “Everything” specifically for her.</p><p>Following his split with Blunt in July 2008, Bublé found love with Argentine actress Luisana Lopilato. The couple got engaged in November 2009 and tied the knot in March 2011 in Buenos Aires. Bublé expressed his affection for Lopilato through his music, co-writing the hit single “Haven’t Met You Yet” while they were dating. Lopilato also appeared in the corresponding music video. Over the years, the couple has been blessed with four children: two sons born in 2013 and 2016, and two daughters born in 2018 and 2022.</p><p>In 2016, Bublé faced a challenging time when his oldest son was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, a form of liver cancer. Upon learning of the diagnosis, Bublé canceled his scheduled tour and devoted his time to supporting his son throughout the challenging journey of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Bublé openly discussed this difficult period during an interview with British talk show host James Corden in 2018. Fortunately, Bublé’s son has since made a full recovery, bringing joy and relief to the family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqagnKCRmrlurtSbo55lp56zpnnMnpytZZyqtrStzZpkpaegnrmiwM5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martha-stewart-kids-daughter-alexis-stewart-with-andrew.html><span>←</span><span>Martha Stewart Kids: Daughter Alexis Stewart With Andrew</span></a>
