You can’t make a person decide to write a song. Creatively, it’s how I feel right now.

The melodies is what struck the chord in him.”</p><p>21 didn’t hold back when <a class=underline-link href=#>taking aim at the trap pioneer.</a></p><p>“Need a bad girl like RiRi (Yeah, yeah)/We don’t pump fake, we kill beef (21)/21 Savage, not Jeezy (Pussy),” he raps.</p><p>Going forward, the Queens-bred rap legend believes people are going to see even more artists from the next generation get inspired by his catalog.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I think you’re going to see more artists mirror some of the things in my music, even if they’re doing it a little different,” he continued. “The cadences are a little different because they’re rapping. Why I pointed out that ‘Many Men’ was the slowest track on Get Rich or Die Tryin’? Because it fits production-wise now.</p><p>“Musically, now, things are slower. They like rapping to R&B beats. It provides more space for them to make changes in the cadences.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/10/20200102-21-save.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>21 Savage Calls Jeezy ‘A Pussy’ On 50 Cent-Honoring ‘Many Men’</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 2, 2020</p></a><p>50 also celebrated another victory this week, claiming his <a class=underline-link href=#>“The Woo” collaboration</a> alongside <a href=#>Roddy Ricch</a> and Pop would rise to No. 1 at urban radio.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Revisit Pop’s 50 Cent-inspired “Got It On Me” below and watch the interview up top.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZlbYZyhY6toK2klWOCcXnCnqWtZZGcv6ax0makmqapYrqmuoyiqmZqYGd9tHnMqKqtZZmjs63BxKeropmcYsCwusZmmJ%2Bslad6sbvPZqqmp5uaenN9jKyYr5mXmnqzscyaop6r</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-chilling-details-tushar-atre-s-kidnapping-murder.html><span>←</span><span>5 facts about Tushar Atre's kidnapping and murder</span></a>
