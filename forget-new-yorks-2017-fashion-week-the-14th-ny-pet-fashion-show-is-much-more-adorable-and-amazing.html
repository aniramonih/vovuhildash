Pets dressed in elaborate costumes inspired by cultures around the globe strutted down the catwalk. The show is billed as the country’s largest charitable pet fashion show. Tickets for the event ranged from 60$ for a single ticket at the door to table reservations upwards of 750$ with proceeds from the show donated to the Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals. Good news for the charity since more than 700 people showed up for the event.</p><p>Check out some cute cat and dog pics in elaborate outfits below.</p><p>Pet fashion designer Anthony Rubio walked with 9 year old model and actress Briella Simpson and his two Chihuahuas Bogie and Kimba.
