The channel is run by Matt, the owner of Winder Towing, and his crew of family and friends. One of the most beloved and mysterious members of the crew is Ed, an 85-year-old man who often accompanies Matt on his rescues. But who is Ed, and how is he related to Matt? Is he Matt’s father, uncle, or just a friend? In this article, we will reveal the truth about Ed and his relationship with Matt.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ed’s Background and How He Met Matt</h2><p>Ed was born in 1939 and grew up in California. He served in the US Army and later worked as a truck driver, a mechanic, and a gold prospector. He has a passion for skydiving, motorcycles, and off-road vehicles. He has been married three times and has two sons and a daughter.</p><p>Ed met Matt in 2009, when Matt bought his shop in Hurricane, Utah. Ed was living on the site at the time, and some people told Matt that Ed was difficult and to evict him. However, Matt decided to let him stay to watch over the property and they soon became good buddies. Ed helped Matt with his towing business and also joined him on his off-road adventures. Ed became a regular and popular character on Matt’s YouTube channel, which he started in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ed’s Role and Personality on the Channel</h2><p>Ed is a friend of Matt and a star on Matt’s Off Road Recovery. He is known for his witty remarks, his fearless attitude, and his love for Corvettes. He often drives his own Corvette, which he modified to be more suitable for off-roading, or rides with Matt in his Jeep or tow truck. He also has his own catchphrase, “What could possibly go wrong?”, which he says before every recovery mission.</p><p>Ed is admired by many fans of the channel for his energy, humor, and wisdom. He is also respected by Matt and the other crew members, who treat him like family. Ed has a special bond with Lizzy, Matt’s daughter, who calls him “Grandpa Ed”. Ed also gets along well with Rudy, Matt’s son, and Jamie, Matt’s wife. He sometimes teases or jokes with them, but he always shows his affection and support.</p><p>Ed is not only a friend, but also a mentor and a role model for Matt. He has taught Matt many things about life, mechanics, and off-roading. He has also inspired Matt to pursue his dreams and passions. Matt considers Ed as his “best friend in the world” and often expresses his gratitude and admiration for him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ed’s Current Situation and Future Plans</h2><p>Ed is currently 85 years old, and he is still active and healthy. He lives in a trailer on Matt’s property, where he has his own workshop and garage. He enjoys working on his vehicles, watching TV, and spending time with his friends and family. He also likes to travel and visit his gold claim in California, where he hopes to strike it rich someday.</p><p>Ed has no plans to retire or slow down anytime soon. He wants to continue his off-road adventures with Matt and the crew, and to share his stories and experiences with the viewers. He also hopes to skydive again, which he has not done since he was 80 years old. He says that he loves his life and that he is happy and content.</p><p>Ed is a remarkable and lovable person, who has enriched the lives of Matt and many others. He is not related to Matt on Matt’s Off Road Recovery, but he is more than a friend. He is a part of the family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuscNmqZ6kkamypXnTqGSmmaSperC6jKaYrayjYrynsoyrppqcXaeypLvVnqmyZaSdsm7A0a6roWWSmrWqusNmq6GdXaW8scHLmqlmsZ%2BqwbauxGaaoZmeo7Ktew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./intimate-photograph-of-wealthy-titanic-victim-madeleine-astor-goes-on-sale-html.html><span>←</span><span>Intimate photograph of wealthy Titanic victim Madeleine Astor goes on sale</span></a>
