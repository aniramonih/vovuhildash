But besides his career, he also made headlines when he married his first wife, Rochelle "Rocky" Parker, 26 years his senior.</p><p class=Xg>The "Grey's Anatomy" star says he learned a lot from the marriage. However, their age difference became an issue with time as, instead of experiencing life together, they wound up going through different cycles in their lives.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Actor Patrick Dempsey and wife Rocky Parker on March 18, 1990 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Xg>There was also the issue of the <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/was-mcdreamys-first-marriage-nightmare-2D80554994>heavy accusations</a> by Parker about his alleged abuse. According to court papers obtained by the National Enquirer, Today reports that Parker accused Dempsey of being physically abusive.</p><p class=Xg>However, Parker would later distance herself from the claims, saying that she had listened to lousy advice to make those and other accusations during their messy divorce and that they were all false.</p><p class=Xg>The <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/home-bodies-vol-58-no-17/>couple's relationship</a> took a nosedive in the early 90s, and in 1991, Parker filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences." They eventually divorced in 1993, after the actor reportedly told Parker he'd met someone else.</p><p class=Xg><strong class=Vg>DEMPSEY MET HIS SECOND WIFE BY ACCIDENT</strong></p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Actor Patrick Dempsey and wife Jillian Dempsey at John Varvatos Los Angeles on March 13, 2011 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Xg>Jillian Fink was checking the appointment book at her chic Los Angeles hair salon when she came across a name that made her heart skip a beat.</p><p class=Xg>She thought her prankster employee was playing a joke on her by pretending to have booked Dempsey. All other clients booked for appointments that day were big names from the 80s, such as Molly Ringwald, and Fink could not believe it when Dempsey turned up for a haircut. She <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/home-bodies-vol-58-no-17/>said</a>:</p><p class=Xg>"I was shocked.

However, at the time, they were both seeing other people. After three years of harmless banter and endless flirting from Fink, they finally got together.</p><p class=Xg>Dempsey did not waste his time and moved fast when he learned that Fink was single through a mutual friend. He called her up and made her pasta for their first date. Three months later, she moved in, and the two exchanged vows two years later, in 1999.</p><p class=Xg><strong class=Vg>WHO IS DEMPSEY'S WIFE?</strong></p><p class=Xg>While many actors and actresses tend to marry within their circles, Demsey chose to be different.
