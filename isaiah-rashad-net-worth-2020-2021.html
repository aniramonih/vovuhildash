His hairdresser mother raised him after his father left the family when Isaiah was 3. Isaiah used to listen to ‘Too $hort’ and ‘Scarface’ with his father late at nights before he abandoned him.</p><p>He initially wanted to be a preacher, but then his passion shifted towards rapping after he was introduced to OutKast’s ATLiens by his stepbrother when he was in junior high school. He casually started rapping after that and took up a serious interest in the genre when he came into class tenth. He and his group of friends started recording their compositions on laptops.</p><p>He went on to attend the Middle Tennessee State University. He got an opportunity to record his pieces for free when one of his friends introduced him to the owner of a recording label who turned out to be Isaiah’s cousin. After his cousin moved on to a different job, Isaiah dropped out of college and kept shifting to places where he can record. His music began to spread around A&R’s (to discover new talent).</p><p>Later in his life, he confessed that he had a suicidal mindset when he was about 19 and contemplated, even tried at times, to take his own life. He always backed out though, for which he is much thankful. He had a son with his long term girlfriend in 2013 and then another child with another woman in 2015.</p><p>During the promotion of his third studio album, he revealed that he was addicted to alcohol and Xanax.

He collaborated with many recognised producers, like ‘MF Doom’ and ‘Flying Lotus’ for the release of his free singles on Soundcloud, which resulted in the exponential growth of his reputation.</p><p>He began getting under the radar of numerous <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">record labels</a> around 2012, but he didn’t pay any heed to the proposals he received. Isaiah’s debut album, ‘Cilvia Demo’, which came out on the 28th of January, 2014 garnered widespread critical acclaim upon its release.</p><p>The album, according to Isaiah, is a summation of his entire adolescence.
