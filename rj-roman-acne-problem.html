Roman lives in Orlando, Florida. Also, Roman is the bass player for one of the best bands, Emuness, right now. Roman has been making music since he was a child. It helps him deal with his stress.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In the same way, when R.J. first appeared on the stage of American Ninja Warrior 10, people started to recognize him. Roman failed the Slippery Summit in qualifying at the end of the season, but at the end of the night, he was ranked 14th overall.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Roman also went back to Atlanta for the eleventh season of American Ninja Warrior, where he had to compete in the Power Tower showdown with Jessica Helmer and Ben Melick.</p><h2 id=is-rj-roman-acne-problem-hereditary><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_RJ_Roman_Acne_Problem_Hereditary></span>Is RJ Roman Acne Problem Hereditary?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>People are asking about R.J. Roman’s acne because most of them want to know if it runs in the family. Roman told everyone before his Stage 2 run in American Ninja Warrior 10 that he had a skin condition called vitiligo.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Vitiligo also causes white spots on some parts of the skin, which can be seen on his fingers. Be worried, because Roman is the first competitor we know of who has a skin problem like this.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But R.J. Roman hasn’t said if it’s a family trait or not. But some sources say that if both of your parents have acne, there is a chance that you will get it too.</p><p style=text-align:justify>R.J. has never said whether or not his parents have the same skin problem, so we don’t know if he got it from them or if he’s the only one in his family with it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>This is a kind of serious problem, so Roman must be taking care of it well. We’ll get more information as soon as R.J. feels comfortable sharing it with us.</p><h2 id=american-ninja-warrior-2022-age-how-old-is-rj-roman><span class=ez-toc-section id=American_Ninja_Warrior_2022_Age-_How_Old_Is_RJ_Roman></span>American Ninja Warrior 2022 Age- How Old Is RJ Roman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>RJ Roman was born on June 23, 1996, so he will be 25 years old in 2022. The semi-finalist was born in Orlando, Florida, and grew up there. R.J. is also a citizen of the United States.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Roman is a musician by trade, and right now he plays bass for the band “Emuness.” In the same way, he cares a lot about his job. Roman hasn’t talked about his childhood job in the media, which is a shame.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But we know that Roman has been interested in music since he was a child, and that he had to deal with many problems as he grew up.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In the same way, information about his education is also a mystery today. Still, R.J. seems to have a good education, and he must have gone to some well-known universities.</p><h2 id=who-are-rj-roman-parentsnbsp><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_RJ_Roman_Parents></span>Who Are RJ Roman Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>The parents of R.J. Roman, who lives in Florida, have not yet been seen on camera. Also, Roman doesn’t say anything when his family or parents come up.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Fans of Sasukepedia say that R.J. has a twin brother, but they don’t know much about him yet. R.J., who won American Ninja Warrior 10, would rather keep his family out of the spotlight.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Roman has never posted photos of his family on any social media site, including Instagram, where he is known as @rjroams and has 5,900 followers.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Not only that, but Roman is dating Hannah S. Roman has, however, kept his love life very quiet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMHRq5ynrF2Ws6etyKuqZ6einHyztoyrpqaZnmKupLrEZqerp5Khsq57</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ambika-rao-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Ambika Rao Wiki, Death, Biography, Age, Parents, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
