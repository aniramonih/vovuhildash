In real life, Molly began her working life wanting to pursue a career as an Olympic skier. She trained in the sport for a number of years, but injured herself while attempting to qualify.</p><p id=e2d9qgoqQKYD data-wc=46>It was this turn of events that led her to begin working in a wholly different environment. After moving to LA in the late 2000s, Molly began working in an underground poker tournament that frequently took place in the basement of famous club The Viper Room.</p><p id=eKHhZ8kPCQkG data-wc=35>Soon after in 2007, she began working for herself running her own poker company named Molly Bloom Inc. and hosted tournaments attended by plenty of famous faces including <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon</strong> and <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>.</p><p id=eH1xeaey1NXL data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Lucifer boss devastates fans with emotional photo from final scene</a></strong></p><p id=ehTkQeJrtXM5 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Bold Type: why is the show ending after season five?</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/76ef007ab09d-molly-bloom-aaron-sorkin-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eimM7WEZb2ns data-wc=7><strong>Molly Bloom with film director Aaron Sorkin</strong></p><h2>What is the story behind the film Molly's Game?</h2><p id=ekSvPqaqiXtt data-wc=57>The film focuses on Molly's rise within the poker industry but things started to get complicated when big money became involved. After being accused of not paying sufficient tax in 2010, she was issued with fines. In 2013, Molly was arrested and charged with being part of a money laundering and illegal sports gambling operation.</p><p id=eNZrIUqHpUm2 data-wc=63>After battling in court, Molly then pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to one year probation and 200 hours of community service. At the hearing, her lawyer, Jim Walden, told the judge that she had been "ordered into the gambling business" by a former boss and that Molly was in severe debt and forfeiting funds as part of the plea.</p><p id=eMepzJCqcByS data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Behind Her Eyes viewers clear up confusing plot detail</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef6b9046bac3-idris-and-jessica-molly-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ePzYGfeSJecl data-wc=8><strong>Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba in Molly's Game</strong></p><h2>What else is there to know about the true story behind Molly's Game?</h2><p id=e0DhijDd_CKr data-wc=53>Molly Bloom worked alongside the filmmakers and even spent some time with Jessica Chastain before the actress took on the role. The real-life Molly told ET Canada upon the film's release: "I was blown away by her performance by how right it was and how deep and understood I felt by her performance."</p><p id=en1k3Elhbqj6 data-wc=57>Screenplay writer and director Aaron Sorkin told NPR that the glamour and celebrity of the poker games is not actually the film's sole focus. "[It's] a story about decency. Molly was an honest-to-God, real-life movie heroine found in an unlikely place. This was a morality tale of doing the right thing when the wrong thing is easier."&nbsp;</p><p id=eSmCjWKgnZ4F data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
