<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt Just Paid $67 Million For Superyacht Abandoned By Sanctioned Russian</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>An abandoned superyacht that was once the property of a <a href=#>sanctioned Russian billionaire</a> has found a new owner. The buyer is <a href=#>Eric Schmidt</a>. Schmidt earned his $24 billion net worth as the former CEO of Google. Eric reportedly paid $67.6 million for the 267-foot, named Alfa Nero.</p><p>The craft was formerly "linked" to Andrey Guryev, one of the many Russian billionaires whose assets have been seized and placed under sanction due to his alleged affiliation with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Guryev's daughter attempted to block the sale, claiming the superyacht actually belonged to her rather than her father. That seems to be at least somewhat contradictory of what Guryev's own attorney claimed back in March:</p><p><strong>"Mr Guryev neither owns nor controls the Alfa Nero and has simply used the vessel from time to time under commercial charter since 2014."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-348933 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1094962316.jpg alt width=900 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-348933 class=wp-caption-text>VWPICS/Nano Calvo/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</p><h2><strong>$112,000 Monthly Maintenence</strong></h2><p>Whatever the details of the Alfa Nero's previous ownership, it ended up abandoned in the port of Falmouth Harbor in Antigua Bay, and the Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority claimed it and put it up for sale. They were reportedly eager sellers, owing to the craft's estimated maintenance and upkeep expenses of $112,000 per month. Why didn't Antigua simply let the yacht rot? Because when a yacht (or plane) is seized, <a href=#>the country where it remains is legally required to continue maintaining the asset</a>. The Antiguan government told Boat International that during the period of the superyacht's time in Antigua, it received over $500,000 worth of fuel alone at the cost of Antiguan taxpayers.</p><p>That's probably why Schmidt got the boat for the relative steal of $67.6 million compared to the reported $120 million that Guryev (or parties associated with him) paid for it back in 2014.</p><p>A portion of the proceeds of the sale will go towards paying its captain, crew, and various creditors that sunk funds into its upkeep.</p><p>As for Schmidt's plans for the yacht, he hasn't commented publicly on his purchase, but whatever they are he's sure to enjoy owning it, since he can afford the upkeep.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfm7yzucSrZKCnn5y5pnnCnqZmnaKesG6%2FwqGkopykYre2v9Nmp5qhlGKDeHnMoqOloZ%2Bjeqe70WaqrqiVp8air8etZJqakaOxsLrEnWSbsV2orq%2Bv06Kmp52UYr%2B2v9KimKdlkp65rbXOp5iiqpVirq%2Bw0Z6wZp%2Blp8amwo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./forbes-riley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Forbes Riley Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
