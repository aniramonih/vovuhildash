From being the place where severed heads were displayed as a warning to potential traitors to dedications to previous monarchs, London's river crossings have played a key role in the city's history.</p><p>Several crossings have existed in the place of the current London Bridge, with the oldest dating back to the Roman times. While there were previously homes and churches on the bridge, it was the trend of putting severed heads on the bridge that is best remembered.</p><p>Whether it was the head of Scottish rebel William Wallace or King Henry VIII's right-hand man Lord High Chancellor Thomas More, a number of heads of high-profile figures were displayed on spikes as a warning to other would-be traitors.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>The fabulous pop star King Charles was 'obsessed' with and had a picture of on his bedroom wall</a></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26249438.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_1.jpg><p>Many of the structures have used the name London Bridge, yet the most modern bridge was opened on March 17, 1973 by the late Queen.</p><p>London Bridge was also the site where the severed heads of mainly high-profile criminals and traitors were displayed on spikes after their beheading. The heads were dipped in tar and boiled to preserve them against the elements, and were impaled on pikes.</p><p>The head of William Wallace was the first recorded as appearing by the order of King Edward I, in 1305, starting a long tradition.</p><p>King Henry VIII also had the head of Lord High Chancellor Thomas More displayed on the bridge after he refused to recognise the annulment of his marriage from Catherine of Aragon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26261803.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_GettyImages-51241437.jpg><p>Other famous heads on pikes included those of the leader of the Peasants' Revolt Jack Cade in 1450, Bishop John Fisher in 1535, and Thomas Cromwell in 1540.</p><p>The memoirs of a German tourist who visited London in 1598 explained the moment he counted 30 severed heads on the bridge. He wrote: "The whole is covered on each side with houses so disposed as to have the appearance of a continued street, not at all of a bridge.</p><p>"Upon this is built a tower, on whose top the heads of such as have been executed for high treason are placed on iron spikes: we counted above thirty."</p><p>The last head was impaled in 1661 during the reign of <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>King Charles </a>II, but the display site was later moved to Temple Bar until the practice of exhibiting severed heads was discontinued.</p><p><b>Want more f</b><b>rom MyLondon?
