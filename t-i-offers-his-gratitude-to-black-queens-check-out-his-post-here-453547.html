Did she not lock up more minorities for weed? Did she not withhold evidence for a minority on death row to keep her record clean? What about the Biden crime bill? Biden and Harris locked up more minorities than any other politicians with their policies! It’s true the blind lead the blind!’</p><p>T.I. just told his fans and followers on social media that the fight is not over yet.
