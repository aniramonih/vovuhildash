In fact, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs shortly held the record of highest-grossing sound film at the time after earning $8 million USD.</p><p>In 1938, it also received the honor of getting nominated for Best Musical Score at the Academy Awards. The producer also awarded an honorary Oscar for the film the next year in 1939.</p><h3><strong>Early Life, Parents & Brief Life Story</strong></h3><p>The princess was born into the royal family. Snow Whites’ mother “Queen Eva” died in childbirth shortly after giving birth to the princess. A year later, her father “the King” married again and his new wife “The Evil Queen” was also a very beautiful woman.</p><p>However, she was a wicked lady and practiced witchcraft. Snow’s dad also died suspiciously after marrying his second spouse. She had a magic mirror who always told her that she is the fairest woman in the world.</p><p>The evil queen used to get extremely happy as the magic mirror never lied. On the other hand, her step-daughter grew up and became more beautiful each day. Therefore, the Magic Mirror then started to tell her that Snow White is the fairest.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Snow-Whites-step-mother-Evil-Queen-offered-her-a-poisoned-apple-which-made-the-young-girl-unconscious.jpg decoding=async alt="Snow White's step-mother Evil Queen offered her a poisoned apple which made the young girl unconscious" width=400 height=301 title="Snow White Height, Weight, Age, Biography, Family & Story 3" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The second queen later ordered a huntsman to take Snow into the forest in order to kill her. The queen also demanded her heart so that she could consume it and became more beautiful.</p><p>But the huntsman spared her life and took the heart of a wild animal instead. Then, her step-mother asked the same question to the mirror. To her surprise, the magic mirror replied Snow is the fairest.</p><p>Later, she became furious and decided to kill the girl herself. Meanwhile, the princess took a refugee at a tiny cottage that belonged to a group of seven dwarfs. The queen disguised herself as a farmer’s wife and went to the cottage.</p><p>She offered her a poisoned apple which made the young girl unconscious. Assuming she was dead, dwarves put her in a glass casket. A prince stumbled upon the innocent princess and was able to revive her in the end. He even proposed her for marriage which she accepted.</p><h3><strong>Body Stats, How tall & Facial Features</strong></h3><p>Snow’s characters were inspired by the traditional European romantic fairy tales. Her beauty is usually marked by her inherent kindness and purity. Furthermore, she is extremely optimistic and trustworthy.</p><p>White’s kindness, beauty, and sincerity attracted the Prince, forest animals, and the Seven Dwarfs. She has a slender figure and Snow White’s height is around 163 cm (5 feet 4 inches tall).</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dreshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Snow-White-age-height-and-weight.jpg decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-95945 alt="Snow White height, weight & age" width=400 height=310 title="Snow White Height, Weight, Age, Biography, Family & Story 4" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-95945 class=wp-caption-text>Snow White’s physical statistics.</p><p>In addition, the young princess blessed with pale skin, rosy red lips, and black hair.
