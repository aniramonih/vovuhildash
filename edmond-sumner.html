Sumner signed a two-way contract with the Pacers on July 5, 2017, becoming the first second round draft pick to sign such a deal. In the 2017-18 season, Sumner struggled for minutes and spent significant time with the Pacers' G-League team, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. This continued into the beginning of the 2018-19 season, but when teammate <a href=#>Victor Oladipo</a> suffered a season ending injury of a quadriceps tendon rupture his playing time increased significantly, and was given his first NBA start, against the Golden State Warriors. On February 11, 2019, Sumner signed a standard NBA contract with the Pacers which was reported to be a two-year contract.</p><p>Sumner spent 3 years playing for the Xavier Musketeers (at Xavier University, Cincinnati) from 2014-2017. He played in 6, 31 and 21 games in each of the years he attended. Sumner was sidelined with an injury in an 82-77 win against St. John's in January 2017 and did not play the rest of the season. At that point, he was averaging 14.9 points, 4.9 assists and 4.4 rebounds per game. This was not the first time he had suffered knee issues; his freshman season was cut to just 6 games as he withdrew from further playing due to chronic tendinitis in his knees.</p><p>Edmond <a href=#>Byron Sumner</a> (born December 31, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A point guard, he played college basketball for the Xavier Musketeers and participated in the 2017 NBA draft.
