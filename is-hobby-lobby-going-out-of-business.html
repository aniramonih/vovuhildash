The company frequently has gone against societal expectations on the grounds of <a href=#>religious freedom</a>, as the founders are devout evangelical Christians.</p><p>Founder and CEO David Green<a href=#>,</a> who is worth approximately $14 billion, has remained at the helm of Hobby Lobby since launching it in 1970. One of the high-profile lawsuits Hobby Lobby faced was in 2014, when the Supreme Court ruled that companies like Hobby Lobby could opt out of providing certain forms of contraception to employees.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Groups like Planned Parenthood disagreed with the decision, while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hobby Lobby stated</a> their case didn't take away women's right to contraception, but only to four types that "could terminate life." Worries ensued that the case could lead to other restrictive employer policies, such as refusal to pay benefits for a same-sex spouse.</p><p>Hobby Lobby also faced criticism for not immediately closing stores during the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 pandemic</a> when ordered to do so. (It eventually complied with closures and furloughed employees.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In July 2022, Hobby Lobby was sued by a former employee for allegedly violating the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans With Disabilities Act</a> (ADA). At an Olathe, Kans., store, managers refused to allow an employee to bring her service dog, which was used to help her cope with symptoms of PTSD. The employee was then fired without the company attempting to provide a reasonable accommodation, the lawsuit said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Hobby Lobby remains a family-owned business.</h2><span id=hobby-lobby-remains-a-family-owned-business class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>Hobby Lobby is a family-owned business, primarily owned by David Green and his wife. In the fall of 2022, Green published an op-ed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Business</a> indicating his plans to give away ownership of the massively valuable company. Green said he "chose God" rather than wealth.</p><p>The wealthy founder stated that he had moved 100 percent of the company's voting stock into a trust intended to continue the mission to support causes he supports. Green later told Stuart Varney, "We really wanted to do something that mattered a hundred years from now," referring to various ministries.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Hobby Lobby founder wants to follow the Bible and its teachings, which led him to make the decision to "give away" the company. Comparing himself to <a href=#>Patagonia founder</a> Yves Chouinard, Green said they're choosing purpose instead of "going public" or selling the company to pass on to his heirs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Green has already spent much of his fortune to further Christian ministries and initiatives, including funding the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. He reportedly spent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$500 million</a> of his own money to create and construct the museum.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Steve Green, son of founder David Green and president of the Museum of the Bible, returned thousands of reportedly "looted artifacts" to Iraq in July 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> reported. The museum was "setting an example for responsible ownership of foreign cultural heritage," said the Post.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Greens plan to use Hobby Lobby money to help fund Christian ministries in various forms. Green refers to this as "stewardship" — using the money from the company he founded in purposeful ways instead of viewing the money as his own.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Hobby Lobby isn't going out of business — at least not yet.</h2><span id=hobby-lobby-isnt-going-out-of-business-at-least-not-yet class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>Green's recent decision to "give away" Hobby Lobby doesn't mean it's going out of business.
