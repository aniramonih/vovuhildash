We have a new, comprehensive, user-friendly website,” Gallagher said. “We are live streaming our council and committee meetings. We have instituted a text and email alert system and regularly produce videos to inform our citizens.”</p><p>In the last four years, Bettendorf has seen an explosion of economic investment in many forms. Gallagher explained that “over 400 new single-family homes have been built, totaling over $170 million in valuation; over 30 commercial infill projects/redevelopments have taken place, totaling over $42 million in valuation; and major project investments total over $190 million in the past four years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/10/TBK2.jpg><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Bettendorf names new Paul Norton principal">Bettendorf names new Paul Norton principal</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Meier Park in Bettendorf being renovated, adding new playground equipment">Bettendorf park to get a makeover</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Downtown Bettendorf Organization improvements make downtown more welcoming">Downtown Bettendorf marks accomplishments</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Gallagher not worried about overcrowding at TBK Bank Sports Complex">Mayor not worried about overcrowding at sports complex</a></h3></li></ul><p>Examples of these major investments include Iron Tee Golf and TBK Bank Sports Complex Phase Il.</p><p>Additionally, there has been plenty of activity downtown, Gallagher said. “Investment near the riverfront has been spurred by the completion of the 1-74 bridge. At the same time, we have completed a Downtown Master Plan to guide new projects to create a destination for entertainment and living downtown,” he said.</p><p>New breweries and restaurants now dot the downtown with plans for future, continued development. Partnerships have been a focus area for Bettendorf over the last four years.</p><p>“Our partnership with the YMCA to build a new aquatics center and ice-skating attraction is a great example of how creating effective partnerships can bring residents wonderful quality of life amenities,” Gallagher said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/07/thumbnail_bgallagher-2019.jpg><p>“Bettendorf is truly a premier place to live, work, play, invest and visit. The team we have in place at City Hall is a large reason for our success,” he said. “I’m proud of the work we have done over the past four years and am honored to serve the citizens in Bettendorf. I look forward to the challenge of moving Bettendorf forward into the future!”</p><p>A 1987 Bettendorf High School grad, Gallagher received his B.A. in Communication Studies and in Psychology from the University of Iowa in 1991 and his Juris Doctorate Degree from Marquette University School of Law in 1994.</p><p>He is a partner in the full service, regional law firm of Gallagher, Millage & Gallagher, PLC in Bettendorf.
