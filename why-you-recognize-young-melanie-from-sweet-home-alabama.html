Although it may be hard to believe now, the actor who played the younger version of Reese Witherspoon's character is&nbsp;<a href=#>Dakota Fanning</a>. She was only 7-years-old when the movie got filmed, but that same year it was released, Fanning had been nominated for a SAG award for her role in&nbsp;I Am Sam, making her the youngest nominee in history.</p><p>Fanning went on to have a flourishing career in the years to follow, with lead roles in movies like&nbsp;Uptown Girls&nbsp;and&nbsp;Charlotte's Web. She continued to work as she got older, appearing in the&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;movies and, most recently, the&nbsp;<a href=#>TNT series&nbsp;The Alienist.</a>&nbsp;In 2016, Fanning spoke about&nbsp;<a href=#>being a child star</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>The Guardian</a>, saying, "Now there was expectation – to fail, to succeed, to come through to the other side."</p><p>Yet,&nbsp;Sweet Home Alabama&nbsp;wasn't just another movie that helped the actor rise to fame. It had some personal significance as it was where she had her first kiss. She told&nbsp;<a href=#>W Magazine</a>&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>), "In between each take, we would do the kiss, and then I would slowly turn away and wipe my mouth off so he couldn't see...because I was trying to be kind. I wasn't really into it." Hey, she was only 7, and having your first kiss on-screen at any age can't be easy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxiaoBze9ahsGaxn6p6s7HCqJ6noaqaerq71KeeZqWVoa6vtcRmnaunnWLAuLHErWShp52aeqK4wJuYpplf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neal-mohan-wiki-youtube.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is YouTube CEO Neal Mohan?
