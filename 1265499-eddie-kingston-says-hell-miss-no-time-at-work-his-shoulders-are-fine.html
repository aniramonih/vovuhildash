Eddie Kingston was said to be a little banged up after facing off with CM Punk at AEW Full Gear on Saturday night, and reportedly left the event with a shoulder injury. According to Kingston himself, however, he’s OK and doesn’t plan on missing any time as it was originally believed.
“Shoulders are fine. We’ll be at any @newwrestling1 on the 20th and we’ll miss no time at work,” Kingston wrote."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
