Actress <strong>Ruby Stokes</strong> is finally sharing her thoughts about fans’ reactions to her <a href=#>Bridgerton</a> season two absence.</p><p>Upon the <a href=#>Netflix</a> period romance’s <a href=#>second season release in March 2022</a>, fans were quick to point out that Francesca Bridgerton was noticeably missing from most of the episodes, despite being a member of the show’s titular family. While Stokes, 22, <a href=#>exited Bridgerton</a> to star in the streamer’s new supernatural series Lockwood & Co., she admitted that she loved seeing people poke fun at Francesca’s whereabouts online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ruby-Stokes-Addresses-Her-Bridgerton-Characters-Disappearance.jpg><p>She told <a href=#>Variety</a> in an interview published Tuesday, February 14, “I did see the memes people were creating, and they tickled me! They were funny and very joyous.”</p><p>But for as funny as she found all the memes and posts, Stokes noted, “I didn’t want to delve too deep sometimes, because you can read a lot of stuff and start overthinking things. I like to end my scrolling somewhere.”</p><p>The star also shared that the choice to leave the hit series “wasn’t an easy decision,” as <a href=#>Francesca’s love story</a> is likely to be the subject of one of the show’s upcoming seasons, just as it is in the <a href=#>Bridgerton book series</a> by author <a href=#><strong>Julia Quinn</strong></a>.</p><p>“It was incredible being part of a cultural moment like Bridgerton,” the star —who plays Lucy on Lockwood & Co. — said of her experience on the show. “The versatility in acting is so joyous, and there was something about Lucy that just drew me to her. I found her very exciting and being presented with that opportunity, I wanted to take it and explore it.”</p><p>While fans may have said goodbye to Stokes, Francesca will continue to stick around. It was <a href=#>announced in May 2022</a> that <a href=#><strong>Hannah Dodd</strong> </a>will take over the role for Bridgerton’s upcoming third season.</p><p>“The only thing the Ton loves more than a scandal is a celebration,” the show’s official Twitter page <a href=#>wrote announcing the news</a>. “Do joyously welcome the newest member to the Bridgerton family.”</p><p>Bridgerton showrunner <strong>Chris Van Dusen</strong> had previously opened up about Stokes’ departure in a <a href=#>March 2022 interview with TVLine</a>, noting, “I love Francesca, but we lost her midway through season 2.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued, “After exhausting all other options, she, unfortunately, had to come out due to reasons beyond our control. Perhaps <a href=#>season 3</a> will be the charm.”</p><p>Before joining the Bridgerton universe, Dodd, 27, appeared in a handful of TV shows, including the miniseries Anatomy of a Scandal and Flowers in the Attic: The Origin. She has already made her Netflix debut, as she starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong></a> in the 2022 sequel film <a href=#>Enola Holmes 2</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmumqliwLW7yp6qZpmUmb%2Bmv9Keqmaglad6o77InZ6eqqSku26vx5qpmpukmr%2B0ecOiqpqooJqus63NnJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhoas-eva-marcille-is-scared-of-kim-zolciak-biermann-kenya-moore.html><span>←</span><span>RHOAs Eva Marcille Is 'Scared' Of Kim Zolciak-Biermann, Kenya Moore</span></a>
