We’ve done some digging into Sima’s stubborn singleton to find out more about him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-82799 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-20-at-10.31.06-1024x573.png alt width=750 height=420 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px">Screenshot: Indian Matchmaking S1 E5 – Netflix<h3>Meet Akshay from Indian Matchmaking</h3><p>Akshay Jakhete is a 25-year-old from Mumbai, India. He had just returned from studying in Boston, USA when he appeared on the show.</p><p>While on Indian Matchmaking, Akshay explained to Sima that he was looking for a woman who was similar to his mother. Now, this obviously does not bode well for a matchmaker, as it’s pretty hard to find someone who will fit the bill. Things became even more difficult for Sima, as Akshay rejected many of her proposed matches based on photos alone.</p><p>Akshay felt pressure from his mother, Preeti, to find a match. His younger brother, Aditya, had married at the age of 23. Akshay felt the clock ticking.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>INDIAN MATCHMAKING:</strong></span></a> We found Nadia Jagessar on Instagram!</li></ul><h3>Akshay Jakhete: Career</h3><p>Akshay speaks about how moving to Boston was a big deal for him. While studying, Akshay had to do things for himself – such as cooking and cleaning – that he was not used to. Akshay speaks about how at home in Mumbai, everything is done for him.</p><p>It is clear that Akshay comes from a very well-off family. His mother, Preeti, shows off the jewels and hand-crafted garments she has saved for her future daughter-in-law.</p><p>Although unconfirmed, we found Mumbai-based company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Prabhanjan Automobiles</span></a> two directors are Preeti and Aditya Jakhete. Preeti also oversees&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Aditya Cars,&nbsp;Akshay Cars, and&nbsp;Jakhete Ventures</span></a>. It could well be that the family business is in cars then, and Akshay has returned to Mumbia to be the director of one of the family businesses.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span style=text-decoration:underline>SEE ALSO:</span></strong></a> Find out about Mumbai’s superstar matchmaker Sima Taparia</li></ul><h3>What happened with Akshay and Radhika?</h3><p>If you have yet to watch the final episode of Indian Matchmaking, there are <strong>spoilers&nbsp;</strong>ahead…</p><p>It looked like Akshay had finally decided on a match with a ceremony called Roka being held.&nbsp;In Hindi, Roka means “stop;” this is an engagement symbolising the search has ended and both families intend to marry their children. Eventually, Akshay&nbsp;chose to marry Radhika.&nbsp;But things did not go as planned for the couple.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>LA Times</span></a>, Akshay said: “A few days later, there were some things which we found out that did not go down well with us, and eventually I called it off.” He did not specify why, but added:&nbsp;“Trust is something [that] once broken cannot be regained in a matter of days — it takes a really long time.”</p><p style=text-align:center>WATCH INDIAN MATCHMAKING ON NETFLIX NOW&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:center><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f4f8.svg alt=? style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><span><span style=text-decoration:underline><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INSTAGRAM</a></span>&nbsp;</span><strong>AND&nbsp;</strong><span style=text-decoration:underline><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FACEBOOK</a></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K1ssuir2aqlZa5qsDYZqqhp6eofKK30qGYsmWalripsdOe</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-housewives-ultimate-girls-trip-season-3-episode-4-release-and-schedule.html><span>←</span><span> The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip season 3 episode 4 release and schedule Fri 24 March 20</span></a>
