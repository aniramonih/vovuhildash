The whole thing was overwhelming, but that blew me away. People were very loving and thoughtful."</p><p id=evrmMafYGSl data-wc=43>During the interview, he was joined by his good friend, and co-star, <a class=hm-link href=#>Kirstie Allsopp</a>, 52. "So many people felt linked to Phil," she explained. "He posted a beautifully written account of what had happened on Instagram, in a very unguarded and honest way.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/a361eac16dac-kirstie-allsopp-d.jpg><p id=e29aHzUXraC data-wc=38>"I was full of admiration for the way in which he and the family dealt with the whole thing.

As a family we are all trying to hold onto the fact Mum and Dad went together and that neither will ever have to mourn the loss of the other one.

And so they did. That was what God had planned for them - and it was a good plan."&nbsp;</p><p id=eBoiyPsbMhs data-wc=23>Explaining that "the car, going very slowly, toppled over a bridge on the farm drive," Phil added that there were no physical injuries.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/db7527dc1565-phil-mother-car.jpg><p id=eKF4lDBNQNG data-wc=56>"Their carer was in the car and managed to climb out of a back window so the alarm was raised quite quickly," he noted. "As many farmers do - my brother had a penknife and so was able to cut the seat belts - he pulled them out of the river but they never regained consciousness.</p><p id=e0IsJDU3ymf data-wc=77>"Although desperately sad and shocked beyond all belief - all family are clear that if there can ever be such a thing as having a 'good end' - this was it. It feels horrendous right now, but after almost 60 years of marriage - to die together on the farm they so loved will, I know, be a comfort in the future. Mum and Dad are together which is precisely where they would have wanted to be."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
