That was the gist of Longoria's message during her interview on "Who's Talking to Chris Wallace?"&nbsp;</p><p>"When I got Young and the Restless, it didn't pay enough for me to live off being an actor," she admitted (via <a href=#>Uproxx</a>). "So I continued being a headhunter and Young and the Restless. And I would hide the fact that I was on Young and the Restless to my clients because they didn't want a dumb actress handling their accounts." Longoria also revealed she refused to admit her identity after being recognized by a fan. "I was like the opposite of a publicist's dream because I was like, 'Don't tell anyone I'm on that show.' Because I was, you know, still making more money on my day job," she added.</p><p>While Longoria's comments certainly weren't positive, Eric Braeden perceived them as the ultimate dig against soap actors. "EVA LONGORIA: you just made derogatory remarks about daytime actors!" <a href=#>tweeted</a> Braeden shortly after her interview. "You simply weren't good enough to survive the pressures of this medium! You were very lucky to get on that 'housewife' show! You did one show in 8-12 days, with mediocre but salacious dialogue!" Our actresses ... Would run rings around you!!" While replying to fans — some of whom did not agree with his approach —&nbsp;<a href=#>Braeden also criticized Longoria's acting</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlbYJ6gY6tn55lqaTCr7OMmqWdZaSdsm6%2BxKyrpZ2jqHqmvsicZJuqkZqxprqMnq2aZZyku6i70aKYZpyilrqiecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tragic-death-bmx-biker-pat-casey.html><span>←</span><span>The Tragic Death Of BMX Biker Pat Casey</span></a>
