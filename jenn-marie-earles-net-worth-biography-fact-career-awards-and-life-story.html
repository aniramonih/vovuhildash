Jenn Marie Earle and Justin Townes Earle were married from 2013 until Earle’s death in 2020. They had a daughter, Etta St. James, who was born in June 2017. Steve Earle ended up firing Justin from the band, citing his son’s drug abuse.</p><p>Earle began his solo recording career with his debut EP Yuma on Bloodshot Records in 2007. He released eight albums in his lifetime, including four on Bloodshot starting with 2008’s The Good Life. His last four albums were released on Vagrant (2014’s Single Mothers and 2015’s Absent Fathers) and New West (2017’s Kids in the Street). His last album, 2019’s The Saint of Lost Causes, dealt with current social issues including the Flint water crisis and the criminal justice system in America.</p><p>Earle traveled all over the U.S., settling in different cities for a short time before moving on. Although his career was cut short, it was prolific; as his website bio describes, “Between releasing four full-length-critically-acclaimed albums, constant touring, multiple stints in rehab, newfound sobriety, being born Steve Earle’s son, amicable and not-so-amicable break-ups with record labels, and facing the trials and tribulations of everyday life, it’s safe to say JTE has quite the story to tell.”</p><p>Earle began his music career touring with his father or performing gigs around Nashville. When he was 14, he started a residency at Springwater Supper Club for a weekly set of seven hours. He said, “I would play Mississippi John Hurt and Lightnin’ Hopkins — blues standards — at Springwater. That was the goal: I wanted to be an acoustic blues guy.”</p><p>Earle released nine albums in total, with his latest coming out in May 2019 titled The Saint of Lost Causes. He received the Americana Music Awards twice, once in 2009 winning the emerging artist of the year award and again in 2011 for song of the year for “Harlem River Blues.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jenn-marie-earle-age></span>Jenn Marie Earle Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jenn Marie Earle’s age is unclear. However, her husband Justin Townes Earle was born on January 4, 1982, and died on August 23, 2020, at age 38.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=husband></span>Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He married Jenn Marie Earle in 2013 and in July 2017, the couple welcomed their daughter Etta St. James. In October 2019, he told the San Francisco Examiner that the couple had moved from California to Portland before the birth of their daughter. Earle spoke to The Boot in 2019 about how having a daughter influenced his music and his outlook on life.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr>pic.twitter.com/2xzZMQSSok</p><p>— Justin Townes Earle (@JustinTEarle) August 15, 2017</p><p>He said, “My daughter is probably the reason I stopped writing songs that were so inward and started looking out into the world. I had to start worrying about the world because of her. I bought her a 9MM [handgun] the day she was born because I’m frightened like hell for her.”</p><p>Earle added that he found it difficult to be a good father while also pursuing his music career and told the outlet: “I’m a good father. I taught my daughter to cuss when the Cubs lose — she’s an Earle, so she’ll be fine. I’m a good father, but I’m as, ***** husband. I’m built for the road; I don’t know what the hell to do at home.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-townes-earle-death></span>Justin Townes Earle Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Townes died at the age of 38.

So many of you have relied on his music and lyrics over the years and we hope that his music will continue to guide you on your journeys. You will be missed dearly, Justin.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CEQIJ3DAtpk/</p><p>After his death was announced on social media, many people took to social media to post tributes. Author Stephen King wrote, “It appears that Justin Townes Earle has died. I hope it’s a hoax but fear it is not. What a loss.”</p><p>Music group The Head and the Heart posted: “RIP Justin Townes Earle… We had the pleasure of playing a few shows together. He was such an immense songwriter and authentic soul. This year is a thief.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cause-of-death></span>Cause of Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Townes’s cause of death was not revealed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin Townes’s net worth is unclear.
