The Hater app website is still up and running, but the app appears to have been taken down from the app store, and the company’s Twitter account hasn’t been updated since 2018.</p><p>Users on Reddit reported not being able to discover many people in their area even in 2019, only two years after the app’s introduction, proving the app’s success was not supposed to stay long.</p><p>The company has not issued an official announcement announcing its shutdown, but it appears to have been shut down. Brendan revealed during his interview with CNBC that the app wasn’t making any money at the time, so they planned to integrate advertising and premium memberships, but it appears that idea never materialized.</p><p>Even if you’ve exhausted the original three possibilities, there are lots of other dating apps to try if you’re still looking for love.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=bookmark>Who Is Kehlani Dating In 2022?
