He’d pop in his headphones, grab a snack, watch a movie and check out the awesome views from his window. But that all changed four years ago, when the <a href=#>Henry Danger</a> star found himself in a scary situation mid-air.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with J-14, Jace recalled the terrifying moment.</p><p>“I was 12 years old at the time,” he told us. “The experience was just crazy. I remember sitting in my seat and I could smell gas. I thought that was weird, but I didn’t think much into it until I heard there had been a gas leak and we had to land ASAP!”</p><p>With hundreds of frightening thoughts running through his head at once, Jace couldn’t believe what was happening.</p><p>“Everyone was panicking — including me,” Jace explained. “I was <a href=#>having a panic attack</a> the entire time and couldn’t help but think we were going to crash.”</p><p>As the plane started to descend for its emergency landing, Jace didn’t know what to expect.</p><p>“When we finally landed, it was really rough,” he opened up. “It like dropped, which was really scary, but I felt so relieved to finally be back on the ground!”</p><p>And while Jace has luckily never experienced another flight like that, to this day, he can’t stop thinking about the incident.</p><p>“It was a really bad plane experience,” he admits. “The situation traumatized me.”</p><p>In fact, Jace tells J-14 that he no longer likes flying.</p><p>“I’ve traveled alone a couple times since then, and it’s not fun for me,” he confesses. “I still have flashbacks of that experience whenever I’m flying and I start having panic attacks onboard that usually last the whole plane ride. To be honest, it probably wasn’t until last year that I started to feel a little better while flying and felt like I was maybe starting to get over my fear a little.”</p><p>After such a scary plane ride, it’s not surprising that Jace says his fears haven’t just disappeared overnight.</p><p>“Anxiety is something I constantly battle with, but I don’t want to let it get the best of me,” he tells J-14. “I try to stay logical, and I think if you have a fear of something, the best thing you can do is not let your imagination be more powerful than the actual facts — that’s what helps me.”</p><p>We’re so glad to hear that, Jace!</p><p>Interview and story by Morgan McMurrin. “Jace’s near-death experience: ‘I thought my plane was going to crash!'” originally appeared in the May 2017 issue of J-14.</p><p>Love J-14?
