I don’t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in October 2010 that Badgley and Lively had split after three years together. “They’re professionals,” a source told Us at the time. “They’re still good friends and hang out on the set.”</p><p>One year after Gossip Girl wrapped, the You star recalled <a href=#>what it was like to continue making the teen drama after their split.</a></p><p>“We were very much caught up in the show, which itself was a six-year endurance test. Our relationship was a part of that and helped us through it,” Badgley told Elle in 2013. “I mean, like anything valuable, it was good and it was bad and it was a learning experience.”</p><p>He added that things can get “warped” when you’re on a hit show and dating your costar.</p><p>“As an actor being in a relationship, you have this opportunity to have something really exceptional, because you don’t have a regimented schedule or lifestyle. But then it can also be very warped,” he continued. “You have on-camera romances, which ordinarily I don’t have a problem with. There are complications being an object of attention. I’ve found it’s a double-edged sword. But I’m happy to wield it.”</p><p>Despite the drama on-screen between all of the characters, Badgley has maintained that he and Lively didn’t have any issues behind the scenes.</p><p>“We were consummately professional,” he said on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in 2015. “And I think we should both pat ourselves on the back for getting through it. … We handled it.”</p><p>Four years later, <a href=#><strong>Chace Crawford</strong> echoed his former castmate’s remarks.</a></p><p>“Not at all. Not in the least,” the Boys actor responded when <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> asked if the real-life relationship caused drama on set. “Most mature people in the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Both Badgley and Lively found love — and named kids James! — after their split. The A Simple Favor star married <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> in 2012 and <a href=#>welcomed four kids</a> — daughters James, Inez and Betty — and a fourth child whose name they have yet to announce. The John Tucker Must Die alum wed <a href=#><strong>Domino Kirke</strong></a> in 2017 and she gave birth to son James in 2020. (Badgley is also the stepfather of Cassius, Kirke’s son from her previous relationship with <strong>Morgan O’Kane</strong>.)</p><p>Scroll through for more from Lively and Badgley on their relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr62typ5kpaGmmrm6ec%2BepadlkpaxqLjEsqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYrK3sdGyq6Ghnpx6tbTEsq2eZaOWtqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adrianne-palicki-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-367239-html.html><span>←</span><span>Adrianne Palicki Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
