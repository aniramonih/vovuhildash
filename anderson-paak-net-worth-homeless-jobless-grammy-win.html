When he was seven, Anderson's father was sentenced to 14 years in prison for assault and battery after brutally attacking his mother. Anderson's mother, a woman of sheer will, built up a successful organic strawberry business that helped the family to move from a one-bedroom apartment into a five-bedroom mansion.</p><p>Anderson enjoyed a privileged teenage until El Niño devastated the crop two years running and pushed his mother's business into bankruptcy. She got married again and made a small fortune as a professional gambler until she, along with her second husband (Anderson's stepdad) was prosecuted for undeclared winnings and went to jail for seven-and-a-half years.</p><p>In 2011, prior to being a musician, Anderson worked at a marijuana farm in Santa Barbara. He was married to his second wife, Jaylyn, a music student from South Korea at the time, and they had a baby together. Anderson was dismissed from his job without warning and became homeless with his wife and their infant.</p><p>Shafiq Husayn, of the alternative hip-hop group 'Sa-Ra', helped Anderson during his struggle that year. Anderson started recording songs for his first album in the same year. The musician released his debut studio album 'O.B.E. Vol. 1' under the name 'Breezy Lovejoy' in 2012 and the album 'Lovejoy' under the same name in 2012. Anderson's first album that was released under his original name was 'Venice' in 2014. 'Venice' gained critical acclaim but made little or no mainstream impact. It was the release of the album 'Malibu' in 2016 which gave Anderson the long-awaited, 'much-deserved', overnight fame. 'Malibu' ranked #9 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart and #79 on the Billboard 200.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/af064095-7f0b-4f02-9c39-ee6d6122cedc.1307119882><p>Anderson then launched a world tour supporting his album <a href=#>'Oxnard'</a> and his then-upcoming 2019 release, 'Ventura.' The latter album earned him his first top-five set on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Album Charts after it debuted at no 2.</p><h2 class=split>Anderson's family</h2><p>Anderson and his second wife, a Korean native, Jaylyn are parents to two sons. Anderson often shares the spotlight with his first-born Soul. The singer-rapper-songwriter is fiercely private about his personal life but does mention her wife in his interviews occasionally. "She's the one who came from Korea, didn't speak [any] English, she's [the one who has] the balls," he said talking about their rough times together with The Breakfast Club.</p><p>Anderson also mentioned that this is his second marriage, but that Jaylyn "is the one that matters."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/95c3e9f3-e0d0-4646-a47b-cb0fb67a45fe.1202142594><h2 class=split>Anderson Paak's net worth</h2><p>The musician's major earning comes from his songs and brand endorsements. Anderson Paak's net worth increased from somewhere around $1 million in 2020 to about $4 million in 2021, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. He is also Vans' global music ambassador.</p><p>Talking about the partnership, the singer-rapper-songwriter said, “I’m honored to be the newest member of the Vans Family and look forward to making history with one of the most respected global brands. I’m thankful for Vans’ partnership with .Paak House and can’t wait to broaden our reach to help even more people tap into their greatest potential.”</p><p>In a 2016 interview with Gigwise, Paak shared that positivity and hope allowed him to overcome his struggles. “There’s gotta be a better ending to this. It can’t be like this,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZ6ZsrO%2FzqdkqZmRoHqvsdNmrqiqpJ16qbvMnqOeq6Nit7Cuy56qrGWXp66uudhmrqKm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexander-dreyschock-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Alexander Dreyschock Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</span></a>
