Her parents began dating in October 1997.</p><p>In an interview, Oscar said that he was at a club in Los Angeles with his friends at 2 a.m. when Shanna stepped in to have coffee with her high school best friend.&nbsp;For both of them, it was love at first sight.&nbsp;They began living together in early 1998, announced their engagement in October of that year, and welcomed Atiana the following year.&nbsp;Shanna explained in an interview that her pregnancy was not intended, but it was understood that if it occurred, it would be great, and if it didn’t, it would be OK.&nbsp;During an interview with Access Hollywood, Oscar said that her tiny daughter Atiana entirely distracts him from boxing and that when he meets Atiana and her mother, he absolutely transforms into a new person, and all of his feelings come out.</p><p>Everything was going well until one day in September 2000, when Shanna saw Oscar accompanying another lady to the Latin Grammy Awards and broke their relationship, bringing a palimony action against Oscar in December of that year for $62.5 million.&nbsp;She said Oscar was an alcoholic who was cruel to her and their kid, as well as using them as a prop to help his public image.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Atiana-De-La-Hoya-1.jpg alt="Atiana De La Hoya" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Her mother was married to Barker for four years.</h2><p>Following her divorce from her father, her mother began dating actor Dennis Quaid in February 2001, but the couple divorced in October of that year.&nbsp;Then, in October 2004, she married Barker.&nbsp;Barker filed for divorce after two years since it was subsequently revealed that he was dating model, singer, and actress Paris Hilton.&nbsp;Both of them hinted at a reunion in 2007, but Barker declared they were no longer together later that year, telling People Magazine they had divorced a few days prior.</p><h2>How many siblings does Atiana have?</h2><p>Atiana is her parents’ only child, however, she has several half-siblings with whom she is very close. She has three half-brothers from her father’s previous relationship, Jacob De La Hoya, Oscar Gabriel De La Hoya, and Devon De La Hoya, and two half-siblings from her mother’s marriage to Barker, a brother Landon Barker and a sister Alabama Barker. Alabama and Landon referred to their mother, Shanna, as an absent mother. Landon said on TikTok that their mother has not been as present in their lives as their father.</p><p>Similarly, Alabama commented on her Instagram account not to portray her mother as a fantastic mother since she has never been truly there in her life.&nbsp;“Did your mothers ask you to see them on Mother’s Day because mine didn’t?” “I’m done keeping it a secret, reality shows,” she said. In response to the charges, Shanna told People that the assertions of her being gone from her children’s life are incorrect and very upsetting.&nbsp;She also said that co-parenting is difficult but that she has always prioritized and will continue to prioritize her children’s happiness and well-being.</p><h2>Her Connection with her father</h2><p>Her father continued to pay child support after her parents divorced but had minimal contact with her.&nbsp;When a fan challenged Oscar about Barker’s claim of parenting his daughter during a Q&A session, he responded he had nothing but respect for Barker. Atiana gets along well with both her biological and stepfather.&nbsp;Atiana said in her selfie confessional on her 18th birthday that she was disappointed when her father missed her birthday celebration, but he is always there and always loves her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Atiana-De-La-Hoya-2.jpg alt="Atiana De La Hoya" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Her father worked extremely hard to further his profession, making numerous contacts along the way and passing on valuable information to her, she said.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Her net worth is still being calculated. Her mother’s net worth is still unknown. Shanna Moakler, her mother, is worth $15 million.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Atiana De La Hoya</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYraGRo65usMRmo5plmKTGonnApaNmmZKkwrV506GcZqukmr1usMCunqGslad6sLKMramarpmoeqOt0aScq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./superstar-pride-tjpk-html.html><span>←</span><span>Astrology Birth Chart of Superstar Pride (Rapper) 2024</span></a>
