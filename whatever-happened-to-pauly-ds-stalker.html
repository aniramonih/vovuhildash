Although Pauly D and Vanessa's interactions seemed very awkward, it didn't stop the latter from making her presence known at every spot the cast visited.</p><p dir=ltr>Believe it or not, Pauly D isn't the only celeb Vanessa keeps tabs on. In 2013, she was featured on TLC's <a href=#>Celebrity Stalking</a> show, where she proudly revealed that she is a celebrity spotter. "I'll go after whoever, whenever," Vanessa explained on the show. "Celebrity spotting is the most important thing to me. It's more important than having a boyfriend, than going to work, than doing anything."</p><p>As for Vanessa's love for Pauly D, nothing has changed. In September 2020, Vanessa shared a Tik Tok video of her taking a trip to visit the former Jersey Shore home, donning an "I heart Pauly D" shirt and mask. Per <a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>, Vanessa sells masks of celebs' faces and continues to follow celebs today. Vanessa's love for celebrities such as Pauly D remains strong, and now she's turned her hobby into a profit.
