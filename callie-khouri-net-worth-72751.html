She was a member of Hollywood Women's Political Committee, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting Women's Media Watch Project.</p><span>1990</span><p>On June 2, 1990, she married David Weaver Warfield, a <a href=#>Writer</a> and a <a href=#>Producer</a>. She later divorced him, and married musician <a href=#>T Bone Burnett</a> in 2009.</p><span>1995</span><p>Her second film as a <a href=#>Writer</a>, the romantic comedy-drama <i>Something to Talk About</i> (1995), earned mixed reviews from critics.</p><span>2002</span><p>In June 2002, Khouri made her directorial debut with her adaptation of <i>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</i>, which grossed a total of $73,839,240 worldwide. The film opened at number two in the box office behind <i>The Sum of All Fears</i><span class=nowrap style=padding-left:.1em>'</span>s second weekend.</p><span>2006</span><p>In 2006, Khouri created, wrote and directed the pilot for the legal television series <i>Hollis & Rae</i> that was produced by Steven Bochco.</p><span>2008</span><p>Khouri directed <i>Mad Money</i> in 2008, a crime-caper film starring Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah, and Katie Holmes.</p><span>2012</span><p>In 2012 she developed ABC‚Äôs country music drama series, <i>Nashville</i>, starring Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere. Khouri's husband <a href=#>T Bone Burnett</a> was the show's executive music <a href=#>Producer</a> and <a href=#>Composer</a> for the first season. Leaving the show shortly after the first season production wrapped, Burnett later stated that he was upset with television executives' treatment of his wife. His assistant and the managing <a href=#>Producer</a> Buddy Miller took over for Burnett in season two. <i>Nashville</i> received positive reviews from critics, and Khouri continued on the show without Burnett's involvement.</p><span>2014</span><p>The National Women's History Museum (NWHM) is a non-profit organization that recognizes powerful women who contribute toward feminist filmmaking, such as Callie Khouri and Susan Sarandon. It also receives support, as well as generous donations, from other women such as Shonda Rhimes, Meryl Streep, and Frances Fisher. On August 23, 2014, Callie Khouri was honored by the National Women‚Äôs History Museum and NWHM Los Angeles Council in "Women Making History Brunch" at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, <a href=#>California</a>, for winning an Academy Award, Golden Globe, and WGA. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs revolutionary,‚Äù said Geena Davis on working with Khouri, who also is the creator and executive <a href=#>Producer</a> of <i>Nashville</i>." ‚ÄúShe creates characters that are in charge of their own fate to the bitter end. Female characters who are in charge of themselves.‚Äù</p><span>2019</span><p>Aside from teaching and film-making, Khouri devotes time to feminist organizations. "Don‚Äôt you think talking about it is important, making the next generation understand that things are still not right for women?" says Khouri. ‚ÄúI feel like I owe aspiring <a href=#>Writers</a> at least the warning that they are picking maybe the hardest thing there is to do in the <a href=#>Business</a>,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter any more how good you are. In some ways, it never really did. Bad movies get made as often as good ones, but so few movies get made now, period. If you write for a studio, you may be one of eight <a href=#>Writers</a>, so it‚Äôs not like you can have an artistic vision of your own and achieve it solely through screenwriting. I was very lucky because Ridley really wanted to tell <i>Thelma & Louise</i>. He wanted to make the movie I wanted to make. But often times that‚Äôs not the case at all. They think your script is a good idea and that‚Äôs all. So they buy it and then they hire two or three other people to take a whack at it and it can be a very disappointing thing."</p><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1957 births</a> <a href=#>American screenwriters</a> <a href=#>American film directors</a> <a href=#>American film producers</a> <a href=#>American television producers</a> <a href=#>American people of Lebanese descent</a> <a href=#>American people of Syrian descent</a> <a href=#>Best Original Screenplay Academy Award winners</a> <a href=#>American women film directors</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>Writers from San Antonio</a> <a href=#>Writers Guild of America Award winners</a> <a href=#>American women screenwriters</a> <a href=#>American television writers</a> <a href=#>Film directors from Texas</a> <a href=#>American television directors</a> <a href=#>21st-century American dramatists and playwrights</a> <a href=#>Best Screenplay Golden Globe winners</a> <a href=#>Showrunners</a> <a href=#>American women dramatists and playwrights</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTlrmttcRmoqGnpae2brrErWSwp6KptW6DkXBsag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bryan-bedford-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Bryan Bedford Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
