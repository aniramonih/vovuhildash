In the visual, the pair were seen shopping as the New York native raps: “My bitch a fashion kill, she be busy popping tags/ She got a lotta Prada, that Dolce & Gabbana.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Another pre-romance slay came in December 2019 when the then-friends attended the <a href=#>British Fashion Awards</a> in London. That night, the “Umbrella” singer looked like Cinderella as she graced the red carpet in a mint green satin mini dress from her label, Fenty. She paired the frock with matching gloves, a sheer duster and coordinating pointed-toe-pumps. The “Purple Swag” crooner, for his part, played it cool in a black oversized blazer, loose-fitting pants and sneakers.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The duo made their <a href=#>red carpet debut as a couple</a> at the Met Gala in September 2021. (The soirée was pushed to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic.) For the occasion, Rihanna and Rocky twinned in cozy garbs. Rihanna stunned in a dramatic Balenciaga overcoat and Rocky turned heads in a quilted cape by Eli Russell Linnetz. Underneath, the “Goldie” crooner donned a dapper black suit.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Months later, Rocky and Rihanna shocked the world when the artists announced they were <a href=#>expecting their first child together</a>. In February 2022, the “Rude Boy” singer showed off her growing baby bump at a Fenty Beauty event in Los Angeles with her beau by her side. She <a href=#>pushed maternity fashion boundaries</a> in a custom ombré look from The Attico that featured sparkling strands of sequins that exposed her belly. Rocky matched her in a purple letterman jacket, ripped jeans and neon sneakers.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After Rihanna <a href=#>gave birth</a> to their baby boy in May 2022, the couple kept a low profile but returned to the spotlight in October 2022 to attend the premiere of <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>. Once again, the musicians complemented each other in sage-colored getups. Rihanna opted for a sparkly gown by Rick Owens that featured a protruding detail at the waist. She accessorized with ballroom gloves and pointed-toe sandal heels. Rocky sported an olive jacket and baggy pants.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The couple made headlines again in February 2023 following Rihanna’s highly-anticipated Super Bowl LVII <a href=#>halftime performance</a> when it was confirmed that the new parents were <a href=#>expecting baby number two</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The “Man Down” artist and “Electric Body” rapper&nbsp;were “surprised the second pregnancy happened so fast,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly after Rihanna unveiled her baby bump during her performance in a bustier and jumpsuit from Loewe, which she accessorized with a custom scarf and jacket by Alaïa. “They wanted another baby and were trying, but the pregnancy came sooner than expected!”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see Rihanna and Rocky’s best couple style moments:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvRop%2Bapp6WeqK6w2aYrJmgYr%2Bwr8qyqmarp5a0qMWMnKauqJyaerTA2KWcZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reem-amara.html><span>←</span><span>Reem Amara Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
