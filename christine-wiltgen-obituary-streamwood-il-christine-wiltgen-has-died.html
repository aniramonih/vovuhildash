Madison was her permanent home at the time.</p><p>Her mother, Barbara (Sullivan) Pokorski, and her father, Donald Pokorski, welcomed her into the world on February 22, 1965. She was their only child. Madison, Wisconsin was her home throughout her childhood as well as her adult life. Her graduation from Madison East High School took place in 1983, and she was awarded her diploma in that year. She went on to pursue a variety of careers, including one in which she worked as a Special Education Assistant for a total of 23 years for the Madison Metropolitan School District. She left her job with the school district not too long ago and is now employed as a Health Unit Coordinator at the UW Health East Clinic in Madison. Her previous job was with the school district.</p><p>The accomplishment of which she felt the greatest sense of satisfaction was the birth of her children, Lindsay and Bryce. Even when they were adults, she never stopped going to see them as often as she could, and the three of them engaged in a wide variety of activities together, such as going to craft fairs, riding bikes and horses, and listening to live music.</p><p>When Christine wasn’t spending time with her kids, she was with Norbert, the man who was becoming her significant other. Riding motorcycles was one of Christine and Norbert’s favorite activities, and Christine often accompanied them on their adventures by riding pillion on the back of Norbert’s bike. The most recent trip that they embarked on consisted of a brief adventure that took them along the Mississippi River. This trip was their most recent trip.</p><p>Christine was well-known for the joyful demeanor that she consistently radiated and the smile that she kept plastered on her face at all times. It was almost as if someone had turned on a light whenever Christine walked into a room. Christine is survived by her children, Lindsay (Richolson) Heady and Bryce (Katrina) Richolson; Her Significant Other, Norbert Staszak; Her parents, Barbara and Donald Pokorski; Her brothers, Jeff Pokorski and Dave (Shirley) Pokorski; Her sister, Lynn (Luke) LaBorde; and a large number of other people. Christine is also survived by her parents, Barbara and Donald Pokorski. On April 15, 2018, Christine peacefully went away.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr8eroKysmaOybsPIpaugnZ5ivKO1066Yq7FdqMGzscCmrqinlGK2rXnCoamiq6Seu6Z51qKjrZ%2BVo3qprdJmm6KdlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./castle-ending-explained-explore-the-tv-series-castle-ending-10019216.html><span>←</span><span>Castle Ending Explained Explore The Tv Series Castle Ending</span></a>
