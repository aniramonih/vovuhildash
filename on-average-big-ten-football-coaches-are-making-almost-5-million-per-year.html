In the Big Ten, that busy schedule leads to some massive paychecks.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After a series of new hires and raises, 14 coaches in the conference are making about $67.8 million per year. That equates to an average salary of about $4.84 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The highest-paid Big Ten coach is Michigan's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Harbaugh</a>, who makes just over $7.5 million per year. He could also earn a max bonus of $1.325 million. Purdue's Jeff Brohm isn't far behind, with a $6.6 million salary and a potential bonus of $1.29 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Harbaugh is the third-highest paid coach in all of college football, while Brohm is the eighth. In fact, nine of the top 25 highest-paid coaches are in the Big Ten.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Get a look at the full list of Big Ten coaches and salaries below, courtesy of Rivals's Blair Sanderson:&nbsp;</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Big Ten FB coaching salaries after new hires & raises</p><p>East</p><p>Harbaugh $7.5M</p><p>Franklin $5.7M</p><p>Tucker $5.3M</p><p>Day $4.5M</p><p>Schiano $4M</p><p>Allen $3.9M</p><p>Locksley $2.5M</p><p>West</p><p>Brohm $6.6M</p><p>Fitzgerald $5.2M</p><p>Frost $5M</p><p>Ferentz $4.8M</p><p>Fleck $4.6M</p><p>Chryst $4.2M</p><p>L Smith $4M<a href=#>https://t.co/WBOijg3u8Z</a></p><p>— Blair Sanderson (@BlairRIVALS) <a href=#>February 12, 2020</a></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even the lowest-paid coach, Mike Locksley, is still in the upper half of all college football head coach salaries. And Rutgers head coach <a href=# title="Greg Schiano Net Worth">Greg Schiano</a>, making his second stint with the Scarlet Knights, will make nearly double what his predecessor (Chris Ash) made last year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Curiously, the only coach whose team made the College Football Playoff last year is towards the lower end of the Big Ten. The $4.5 million salary of Ohio State's <a href=# title="Ryan Day Net Worth">Ryan Day</a> is still nothing to sneeze at, though it's slightly below average for the conference.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ohio State's appearance in the College Football Playoff broke a two-year drought for the Big Ten. The Buckeyes lost 28-23 to eventual runner-up Clemson.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since the playoff began in 2014, the Big Ten has sent a representative in four of six seasons – Ohio State three times and Michigan State once. The Buckeyes won in 2014 but Big Ten teams haven't reached the title game otherwise.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The conference will look to post another strong season this year. And its coaches will be reaping the rewards of the prestige that comes from leading a team in the Big Ten.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293993 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-619042534.jpg alt width=900 height=612 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293993 class=wp-caption-text>Gregory Shamus/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqilZpmmmr%2Bis8RmmaKfXamyr3nFqKatmpGhuW6vzpqaoZ2jYq6zsYymmKShnpx6orjMqKqtZWViuqq4y6Kmp2Wgmr9uxcSaqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-dalton.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Dalton Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
