<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Karan Johar is to reportedly release 7 films in the next 12 months</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2023/jun/karanjohar41686140161.jpg> Karan Johar's production company Dharma Production has been involved in a number of Bollywood blockbusters over the years. This year, Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani has emerged as one of their most anticipated movies. Since the release of its first look, this film has sparked a great deal of fan interest because it reunites Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt following their remarkable performance in Gully Boy (2018). Notably, this is also Karan Johar's first film as a filmmaker in seven years. Dharma Productions, however, promises an intriguing slate of projects and has much more in store for the future 12 months.<p>Seven films by Karan Johar are currently in various stages of production and are expected to be released over the course of a year. Yodha, an action-packed movie starring Sidharth Malhotra, Disha Patani, and Raashii Khanna, is also on the schedule. Mere Mehboob Mere Sanam stars the outstanding couple, Vicky Kaushal and Tripti Dimri. The highly awaited KC Sakaran biopic, which stars the talented Akshay Kumar, is another interesting endeavour. Among the notable films in Karan Johar's filmography are Sara Ali Khan's Ae Watan Mere Watan, Sarzameen, starring the famous Kajol, Prithviraj, and Ibrahim Khan, and the love story Mr Aur Mrs Mahi, starring Janhvi Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao. For moviegoers, the intriguing lineup promises a stimulating year ahead.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2023/jun/karanjohar11686140180.jpg width=1200 height=900 alt="Karan Johar" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>According to a source close to a leading news portal, "The 7 films will be released over the period of the next 12 months across platforms. While Ae Watan Mere Watan is their next made-for-OTT, the rest of the films are touted to be theatrical releases. There was an industry buzz about Sarzameen being a direct-to-digital venture, but now, even that is confirmed for a theatrical release."<p>Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani and Mere Mehboob Mere Sanam will officially be released on July 27 and August 25, respectively. However, the release date for Yodha has yet to be determined. Yodha was originally scheduled to open in theatres in September, according to reports. The release date has been moved, nevertheless, to avoid a clash with Shah Rukh Khan starrer Jawan. Karan Johar is reportedly constantly observing the release dates of other movies in order to make educated decisions about the other films on his slate. As per reports, Sankaran and Sarzameen are scheduled to premiere in 2024.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2023/jun/karanjohar21686140189.jpg width=1200 height=900 alt="Karan Johar" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Another set of films is reportedly the adaptation of the romance drama Pariyerum Perumal, which will star Siddhant Chaturvedi and Tripti Dimri.
