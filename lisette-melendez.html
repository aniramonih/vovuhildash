She continues to tour as of 2006.</p><p>Four more albums followed, including her second album True To Life in 1994 which spawned the Billboard Hot 100 hit "Goody Goody" (#53), A Day In My Life (Without You) (#49) and "Will You Ever Save Me" which charted on the Rhythmic Top 40 at #38. The album did extremely well in Japan, both commercially and critically. In 1998, she released her third album, Un Poco De Mi in 1998, a salsa album sung in Spanish. It scored a hit with "Algo de Mi" which peaked at No. 8 on the Latin Tropical/Salsa Airplay chart and No. 23 on the Hot Latin Tracks chart. Her fourth album released later in 1998 is titled, "Imagination." The lead single from "Imagination" was "Time Passes By."

She is best known for her 1991 hits "Together Forever", #35 at the Billboard Hot 100 and "A Day In My Life (Without You)". Both songs were such big dance music hits that they are credited as helping renew interest in Freestyle music in the early 90s, which had been fading in popularity due to the drop in mainstream pop music and rise of grunge at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfoba0sdOtnGallaGyr7DEsw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leven-rambin-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Leven Rambin Net Worth 2024: Career Earnings, Real Estate and Financial Overview</span></a>
