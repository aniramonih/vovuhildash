The group was first known as the Lickle Rinsers Crew, but quickly changed their name to N-Dubz.

A few months later, it was announced that N-Dubz had left Polydor Records and signed to All Around the World Records, home to <a href=# title="Ice Cube Net Worth">Ice Cube</a>'s 'You Can Do It' album. As a result of the success of the debut N-Dubz album, released in November 2008, Tulisa and the band headed out on their first headline tour. 'Against All Odds', the band's second album, was released in November 2009 and featured Tulisa singing a solo song, 'Comfortable.' Within two months of its release, it was certified platinum.
