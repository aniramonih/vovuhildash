There are obviously bigger points of reflection — like where I want to live in five years and how to make meaningful change — and then there are smaller, more easily digestible points, like how my life has changed in the past 12 months. As it turns out, in a lot of ways, actually.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The summer of 2021 was when I finally settled back into my life in New York City after living with my parents for over a year; I didn't feel super secure living alone, as it was my first time in my adult life doing so. I was re-learning how to do New York in the midst of a pandemic, and just adjusting to, well, a post-quarantine life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This summer, I realized how much has changed since 27-year-old Eva moved back to the city — and while some things have gotten harder, most have improved thanks to a mix of friends, family, and of course, products I've acquired over the year that have made this summer better than the last.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the biggest game changers that have given my summer a total glow up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-windmill-air-conditioner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Windmill Air Conditioner</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I moved into my apartment last July, I didn't even bother getting a new A/C unit. I loved my big, bright windows and didn't want to block the light, and it was anyway nearing the end of the super hot, humid season. But this summer was another story — multiple heat waves (and concerned friends) eventually forced me to get a unit, and after hearing so much about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">the TikTok-viral Windmill</a> — which is basically the Tesla of A/C units — I tested it out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many hot days later, the Windmill has truly changed my apartment for the better. Installation was a breeze (pun intended), and the small-but-mighty, aesthetically pleasing design (I know, I never thought I would say that about an A/C) doesn't make me hate looking at my window. Aside from the top-notch design, the Windmill is quiet and cools the room incredibly well. I also love that the cool air blows out from the top, so I can comfortably sit in front of my window without freezing. Another point of mention is that everything can be controlled through your phone once the A/C is connected to your Wi-Fi — even when you're not home. Hot tip: Turn it on a few minutes before you come home to a fresh, chilled space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $365–$395 (Originally $415); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">windmillair.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-july-checked-plus-suitcase></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>July Checked Plus Suitcase</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Didn't you hear? It's the summer of travel — and travel hiccups (oy vey!). But even before everyone decided to book getaways galore in summer 2022, I was already getting in those SkyMiles. NYC to Minnesota! Minnesota to Nantucket! New York to Nashville! And back to Minnesota! All this made me realize two things: 1) I need to invest in TSA pre-check and 2) nothing beats high-quality luggage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">July's Checked Plus</a> is just that, and frankly, I don't know how I packed a suitcase before this one. It's pretty and so well-designed. It weighs a mere 10.5 pounds — which is essential if you pack a lot like me — and its exterior is made for brutal, rough and tumble airport conditions. I might be biased considering I'm German, but that German polycarbonate shell really can't be beat. Because also, life's too short to deal with broken luggage, right? Right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$345; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">july.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cariuma-salvas-sneakers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cariuma Salvas Sneakers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I've waxed poetic about Cariuma's leather sneaker</a> before, and I'm about to do it again.

And while, yes, it took me a while to find my holy grail strapless bra, I can confidently say this On Gossamer pick is the best I've ever worn. It has the perfect amount of padding, a pretty lace design, and no-slip silicone edging that doesn't make me feel like it's slipping every two seconds.
