Lover. Like Donald, he is also a musician, a rapper whose tunes you can hear in the show Atlanta. The breakthrough self-titled track of Brian Tyree Henry’s “Paper Boi” featured in the pilot episode is actually performed by Stephen, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ noted</a>.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Stephen is part of a creative collective known as Royalty that backs many of Donald’s creative endeavors, including Atlanta and the latter’s real-life rapper career under his stage name Childish Gambino.

That’s a pretty impressive glow-up when you consider Stephen once didn’t have showbusiness ambitions whatsoever.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Before joining his brother out west in Hollywood, Stephen set his sights on chemical engineering, an academic field he studied at Georgia Tech for a few years, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. However, the college life did not pan out for him and he took up irregular work in fits and starts in Atlanta thereafter. One of those odd jobs included being an airport pitchman for credit cards, which later inspired a subplot for Donald’s Atlanta character, Earn.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ol’ Stevie (@steve_g_lover)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=false>After Stephen (who is also an executive producer of Atlanta) joined Donald in his creative endeavors in 2012, it brought a number of opportunities, including being the writing force — alongside his brother — for the upcoming Lando. With Donald presumably in the starring role as the roguish pal of Han Solo, in a reprisal of his 2018 role from Solo: A Star Wars Story, we can imagine the series will be a familiar setup for creativity to flourish for the siblings. Suffice it to say, we look forward to Stephen’s work in Lando and beyond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmnJ%2Bjrq2wjKCjqK6Vp8BurtGoq6GdomLAtbHPoZynZZehvLex0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-attorney-matthew-nilo-bio-age-fiance-law-school-and-firm-reddit-linkedin.html><span>←</span><span>Who is attorney Matthew Nilo, bio, age, fiance, law school and firm, Reddit, LinkedIn</span></a>
