So, who is she, and who is the mother of his first three kids?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Nate Robinson Apologized To Mother Of His Three Children</h2><p><span><span>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mother </a>of Nate's first three kids is&nbsp;Sheena “Shanna Rae” Felitz. The pair&nbsp;were high school sweethearts. They had been dating each other, on and off,&nbsp;for years.</span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span>During their relationship, they gave birth to three kids Nyale, Nahmier, and Nayvi. Nahmier, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born </a>on&nbsp;October 27, 2004,&nbsp;is the eldest of them all and goes by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nickname</a>&nbsp;Meezy.&nbsp;Nyale, aka Rico, is the second child <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born </a>on July 16, 2006.&nbsp;Nayvi, who also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">goes </a>by the name&nbsp;Blue, is the youngest of the children. She was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born </a>on 18 September 2009.</span></span></p><p>Nate's family life had appeared to be going on fine, but out of nowhere, he posted a detailed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">apology note</a> on his Instagram in 2016.&nbsp;(The apology post is not available on his Instagram now). Through it, he had asked his long-term partner&nbsp;to forgive him for being a 'bad guy on and off.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The apology confused many of his fans initially, but it was all clear after he posted pictures welcoming&nbsp;his new and fourth child, Nasir, into the family; the kid was conceived by another woman while still in a relationship with Sheena. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>It turns out the apology didn't work out because Nate<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;posted</a> a photo with his former girlfriend and the children with a remorseful caption&nbsp;“Hate saying goodbyes ... Especially When the goodbye isn't the way you would have wanted it”. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Is Nate Together&nbsp;With Nasir's Mother After Split With Sheena?&nbsp;</h2><p><span><span>Despite the public apology and remorseful posts, Nate remained unforgiven. He never got back with Sheena. But, some questions remained, did he get together with the mother of his fourth kid, Nasir. And, who is she?&nbsp;</span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span><span>However, the&nbsp;identity of Nasir's mother and her whereabouts has been kept private. There is no revelation of whether Nasir's mother is his current wife, girlfriend, or if they have already&nbsp;gone separate ways.</span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span>It is only known that Nate and his children are enjoying life together.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Moreover, his children, from the looks of it, have forgiven their father's transgressions. Especially, Nahmier has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a>&nbsp;several photos with his father.</span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Like Father, Like Children: All Enjoy&nbsp;Basketball!</h2><p>Except for Nasir, who is still a toddler, all of Nate's children enjoy and play basketball. Given that Nate was a star player in his time, it is of no surprise that all his kids enjoy basketball and are even looking to follow in his footsteps.</p><p>Nate even jokingly posted on Instagram that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nahmier</a> and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nyale</a> were born in the game. Moreover, he also said that the&nbsp;real player in the family was his daughter Nayvi. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>Following his father's footsteps, Nate's eldest son, Nyale, and his team even&nbsp;got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">qualified </a>for State Basketball Championship in 2019.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><span>With his children following basketball, there is a chance that at least some of them will achieve as much as, if not more than, what Nate Robinson achieved in his basketball career.</span></p><p>Interestingly, Nate isn't confined to basketball only. He is trying on new things. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fought</a>&nbsp;and lost&nbsp;YouTuber Jake Paul on November 28, 2020, in Robinson's in-ring boxing debut. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His fighting career may take some time to emulate his 11-years-long basketball career, which saw him win three NBA slam dunk contests and leave a legacy that motivates hundreds of aspiring players even today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnnpbBpnnRqJmipqOku27DyJ%2BcZpuYnrmlvsSnZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diane-kruger.html><span>←</span><span>Movies starring Diane Kruger</span></a>
