Webb Simpson did have Paul Tesori on the bag but this changed in 2023 when the American announced the partnership would be ending.&nbsp;
The American confirmed the news in a statement, which reads: “After over twelve years of working together, Paul Tesori and I have made the hard decision to change directions. This was an incredibly difficult decision for both of us, one that we have thoroughly considered after spending many hours in prayer, seeking counsel from mentors, and having countless conversations together."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This was an incredibly difficult decision for both of us, one that we have thoroughly considered after spending many hours in prayer, seeking counsel from mentors, and having countless conversations together.”</p><p>“I could have never done this without Paul by my side,” Simpson added. “Not only has he been my caddie and swing coach, but one of my best friends in the world. … Pauly, Michelle, Alexis, Isaiah and their family will always be part of Team Simpson. Their family has become our family and our family has become theirs.”</p><p>We are yet to confirm who Simpson has brought in to replace Tesori, a man he had immense success with.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Ponte Vedra, Florida, Tesori is a very good player himself after competing at college for the University of Florida. Eventually he played 20 events on tour himself, including 9 on the PGA Tour. They were all in 1999 and yet he quickly turned his attention to caddying.</p><p>The pair have been together for some of Simpson's career highlights including his 2012 US Open and the 2018 Players Championship. In fact Tesori cites TPC Sawgrass as his favorite course to caddie at whilst his favorite course to play is Augusta National.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>But it has not always been plain sailing on tour. Tesori was the man responsible for helping Simpson switch from an anchored stroke which became banned at the start of 2016. Tesori basically had the idea of switching sooner rather than later so they could get ahead of the ban, which he believes probably cost Simpson around $5 million dollars.</p><p>He explains as such on a podcast where he says;&nbsp;"We went in a year early, which was my call, and that cost us at least $5 million because the next year I think he finished third in ball-striking and only made about $1.5 million. We went in and looked at his average putting throughout his career and if he had an average putting year he would have been second on the Ryder Cup list, he would have won a couple of tournaments and he would have made about $6 million."</p><p>Tesori has also caddied for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/gear/gear-news/vijay-singh-whats-in-the-bag-176148 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/gear/gear-news/vijay-singh-whats-in-the-bag-176148 data-before-rewrite-localise=/gear/gear-news/vijay-singh-whats-in-the-bag-176148>Vijay Singh</a> in the past too. Paul Tesori is married to Michelle, who runs Olympus Foundation Management, a non-profit organisation designed for pro-athletes. They have a son called Isaiah. Additionally, they both play a part in the Tesori Family Foundation that was founded in 2009 in which they give back to the less fortunate.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently Tesori is carrying the bag for young American <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/cameron-young>Cameron Young</a>.
