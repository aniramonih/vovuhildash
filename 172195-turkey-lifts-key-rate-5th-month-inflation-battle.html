Turkey's central bank sharply lifted its policy rate for the fifth month running on Thursday as part of its politically charged battle against historically high inflation rates.
The bank said it was taking its main lending rate to 35 percent from 30 percent because &#34;inflation readings were above expectations&#34; over the past three months.
Turkey's official annual inflation rate peaked at 85 percent last October and climbed back up above 60 percent last month."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
