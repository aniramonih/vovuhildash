He spent the next two years polishing his pitching skills in the Minor Leagues, and made his Major League debut with the Cardinals in 1997. He finished his first season tied for second as Rookie of the Year. After recovering from Tommy John surgery, he went on to distinguish himself as an excellent pitcher while with the Cardinals.</p><p>He hit his stride during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, and was an All-Star selection for both years, and the 2001 NL Comeback Player of the Year. He played for the Cardinals until 2005. He then signed with the San Francisco Giants, and played for the team until 2007.
