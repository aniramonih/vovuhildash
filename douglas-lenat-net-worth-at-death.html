He published a critique of traditional random-mutation Darwinism in 1980.</p><h2>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</h2><p>At his death, Douglas Lenat’s net worth was estimated to be between $1 million and $4 million. Before Cyc, Lenat significantly advanced AI through the creation of AM (Automated Mathematician) and EURISKO in the 1970s. Unlike EURISKO, which served as a general-purpose learning program for multiple areas, AM concentrated on uncovering new mathematical facts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfqrStrdJmo56mkal6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqLAjJ2cmqyYZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dominik-koepfer-net-worth-in-2023-how-rich-is-he-now-1555153767.html><span>←</span><span>Dominik Koepfer Net Worth in 2023 How Rich is He Now?</span></a>
