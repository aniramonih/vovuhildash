But in private, Lauper was at the mercy of psoriasis.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Cyndi Lauper is the icon who influenced Hollywood with her boundless fashion with a generous array of colors and ethereal style. Of course, Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish perfectly fit this description in more recent times, but Lauper is one of the best ever to do it.</p><p>With her colorful signature brand, funky hairstyles, and her bubbly personality, Lauper made a mix of pop and rock. However, while she stole the hearts of many and gave the “girls” permission to “have fun,” she battled a private ailment. Here’s a look through the singer’s <a href=#>health </a>struggles.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CRotPKaDSla/?utm_medium=copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cyndi_Laupers_Timeless_Songs></span>Cyndi Lauper’s Timeless Songs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lauper burst into the music scene, taking the 80s pop period by surprise. She was <a href=#>quite the anomaly</a> because of her eccentric fashion choice, makeup, and funky hairstyle.</p><p>However, Lauper’s music was very relatable and thanks to this, she was able to gather a large following. Her debut album, “She’s So Unusual,” pretty much described her essence.</p><p>She created classic pop anthems like “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” “True Colors,” and “Time After Time.” Lauper’s liveliness was infectious, and her songs have since transcended through different eras.&nbsp;</p><p>While she worked on her craft and churned out great music, she was also getting duly recognized. After releasing her first album, Lauper won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1985.&nbsp;</p><p>The subsequent years saw her ascending to the upper echelon and bagging more awards. Lauper received Tony Awards, Emmy Awards, and an MTV VMA accolade; after four decades in the business, she is still not relenting.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CUDgjIRrjF0/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Psoriasis_Diagnosis></span>Psoriasis Diagnosis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While she kept up with the music world and went on tours, Lauper experienced a health issue that altered her personal life. She was diagnosed with psoriasis in 2010, and since then, has silently fought the ailment. Psoriasis is a skin disease with symptoms that manifests as itchy scalps and joints and scaly patches.</p><p>Lauper<a href=#> found out about her condition</a> in 2010 after doctors diagnosed her. Before making medical inquiries, the singer would often feel bouts of pain and an itchy scalp.</p><p>While Lauper was on tour, she started feeling irritations on her scalp. It became more painful with time, and she thought it was because she heavily dyed her hair.&nbsp;</p><p>After her diagnosis, the “Memphis Blues” crooner developed a flaky scalp, and the pain she initially felt on her head spread to other parts of her body. By 2015, Lauper felt the impact of psoriasis more.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CUVhGV9LiEO/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Laupers_Tragic_Journey_With_Psoriasis></span>Lauper’s Tragic Journey With Psoriasis&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The malignant symptoms of psoriasis ultimately led to a decline in her ability to work. Lauper was also bedridden for some time and as a result, she had to stop singing for a while, which was of course heartbreaking.</p><p>In a 2015 interview with <a href=#>People</a>, the mom-of-one shared that her health deteriorated so much that she “felt like the elephant man.” The 68-year-old recalled trying various natural remedies she could find.</p><p>She also had to let go of some of her signature looks. Lauper resorted to wearing wigs and cladding her body in turtleneck outfits which ultimately made the “Change of Heart” singer feel “like a nun.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYC2UBA0mZ/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Lauper_is_Handling_Her_Psoriasis_Diagnosis></span>How Lauper is Handling Her Psoriasis Diagnosis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cyndi Lauper’s songs often communicate a need to live in the moment, but her health struggles ate up her social confidence. However, she had to find a strength within her, even more, profound than her songs.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing Lauper realized in all of her ordeals was that “life is for learning.” Even though she lost her voice in the throes of psoriasis, she never relented from “getting up and trying.”</p><p>In 2016 the star revealed to <a href=#>Closerweekly</a> that she always tried to “bring a lot of light” to herself amid the darkness of her illness. Being “a family person” has also helped Lauper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>According</a> to the “Hat Full of Stars” crooner, over 7.5 million people <a href=#>live with psoriasis</a>, and this information has helped her realize that she is not alone. The star has also helped those living with the condition to stay strong.</p><p>Since 2015, Lauper has partnered with the National Psoriasis Foundation and Novartis, launching a campaign, MoretoPsoriasis.com. The foundation is aimed at informing the large populace of skin disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year in December, fans got to see the music star bring on her radiance as she performed her songs at the New Year’s Eve celebration. Cyndi Lauper and Billy Porter, another star entertainer, brought in the heat with a duet of her song, “True Colors.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksLq6w6JkpZmlpbKzv4ytqZqfmZh6sb7Ir5itnV2htqexjKGcmqSknXq0wNGunqCklah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-take-bc-powder.html><span>←</span><span>How to take bc powder</span></a>
