<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Job Gone Wrong Bank Robbers Persuasion</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Upon your first visit to Akila City in the Cheyenne system, you will be assigned the Job Gone Wrong mission for the Freestar Collective Faction.</p><p>As you approach the city gates, a security guard will advise you to avoid GalBank due to an ongoing hostage situation.</p><p>Outside the bank, you’ll meet the Akila City Marshal, Daniel Blake, who will inform you that the bank robbers are unwilling to negotiate with Freestar Rangers. Luckily, you are considered a neutral party.</p><p>So, in this Starfield guide, we will provide a detailed walkthrough of the Job Gone Wrong mission, including how to persuade the bank robbers to surrender inside GalBank and what happens if you fail.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_to_Start_the_Starfield_Job_Gone_Wrong_Faction_Mission>How to Start the Starfield Job Gone Wrong Faction Mission</span></h2><p>You will most likely visit Akila City for the first time with Sam Coe during The Empty Nest main story mission or during the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Late Bloomer side mission</a> to find and speak with Leah Casler.</p><p>When you visit Akila City as part of The Empty Nest main mission, the Job Gone Wrong mission becomes mandatory due to a hostage situation, which prevents you from retrieving Solomon Coe’s maps from the GalBank vault.</p><p>As soon as you arrive in Akila City, you can make Sam Coe your Active Companion by speaking to him at the spaceport. Otherwise, simply head through the city gates and talk to the security guard at the entrance.</p><p>If you have Sam Coe alongside you, ensure that you wait for him to catch up before approaching the security guard who is blocking the entrance to Akila City so that he can participate in the conversation.</p><p>You can trigger a prompt that reads “Sam Coe Liked That” by selecting the dialogue option that says, “If people are in danger, then I want to help“.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-location-guard-1024x576.jpg><p>Once the security guard informs you about the hostage situation, head through the Akila City gates. You will find Marshal Daniel Blake, who is attempting to negotiate with the bank robbers.</p><p>Speak to Marshal Daniel Blake outside of GalBank, who will give you more details about the hostage situation before accepting your offer to help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-location-marshal-daniel-blake-1024x576.jpg><p>There are two options to complete the Starfield Job Gone Wrong mission from this point.</p><p>You can persuade the Bank Robber Leader to release the hostages and surrender without violence.</p><p>Or, if you fail the negotiations, you can sneak inside the GalBank and eliminate the bank robbers before any hostage gets hurt.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_To_Persuade_the_Bank_Robbers_To_Surrender_in_Starfield>How To Persuade the Bank Robbers To Surrender in Starfield</span></h2><p>To begin negotiations with the Bank Robber Leader, interact with the intercom next to the front door of GalBank.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-bank-robber-leader-1024x576.jpg><p>Before attempting to convince the bank thieves to surrender, there are some important details to consider.</p><p>Although Persuasion largely depends on chance and your Persuasion Skill Level, you should know that your negotiation with the Bank Robber Leader is divided into two parts.</p><p>This means that you will have two chances to persuade the bandit. However, it is important to note that these opportunities have significant differences.</p><p>The first persuasion scenario can give you a huge advantage in negotiations, while only the second persuasion attempt can actually free the hostages. This means the hostages can only be released in the second persuasion scenario.</p><p>During the first persuasion attempt, you must gain the leader’s trust by earning 8 Persuasion Points, and you will have three turns to do so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-bank-robber-leader-persuasion-success-1024x576.jpg><p>If successful, your chances of persuading him to release the hostages in the second scenario will increase significantly since you’ll have to earn only 6 Persuasion Points this time.</p><p>Once you earn the leader’s trust or upset him, he will list his demands. You can then trigger a second persuasion attempt, where you can free the hostages.</p><p>In order to initiate the second persuasion attempt, you need to choose the dialogue option, “[Persuade] It’s not too late to end this peacefully.” after the leader has told you his demands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-bank-robber-leader-persuade-1024x576.jpg><p>Selecting any other option will prevent you from completing the Job Gone Wrong mission without violence.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, you’ll have three turns to earn 6 Persuasion Points if you earned the Bank Robber Leader’s trust during the first persuasion scenario. In case the conversation went south, you’ll need to earn 8 Persuasion Points instead.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that persuading the leader to release the hostages and surrender is a matter of chance.</p><p>Therefore, feel free to choose the dialogue options that you believe have the best chance of success. If you are successful in persuading the leader, the Starfield Job Gone Wrong Mission will be considered complete.</p><p>You can then return to Marshal Blake, have a brief conversation, and receive your pouch of Credits. Additionally, you will be assigned to the Deputized Side faction mission for the Freestar Collective.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-completed-1024x576.jpg><p>If you failed to persuade the Shaw Gang’s Leader to surrender, return to Marshal Blake to discuss a plan B.</p><p>After the peaceful approach has failed, the only way to free the hostages is to infiltrate the GalBank and eliminate all the Shaw Gang members.</p><p>When you speak with Marshal Blake, he will give you the GalBank Rear Door Key and the following options to handle the situation:</p><ul><li>Ask to see the hostages.</li><li>Sneak into the bank.</li></ul><p>Whatever option you choose, be ready for a fight because you’ll inevitably have to face the bank robbers and eliminate them in the Starfield Job Gone Wrong mission.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_To_Ask_To_See_the_Hostages_in_Job_Gone_Wrong_Mission>How To Ask To See the Hostages in Job Gone Wrong Mission</span></h2><p>If you plan on infiltrating GalBank by asking to see the hostages, use the intercom and choose one of the two dialogue options about the hostages.</p><p>The leader of the Shaw Gang will approve your request, but only if you enter unarmed. However, you can try a third persuasion scenario by selecting the option “[Persuade] Just hear me out for a minute”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-ask-to-see-the-hostages-1024x576.jpg><p>It is risky to enter a hostile area without any weapons, so it’s better to try persuading the bank robbers to let you in with your firearms.</p><p>But if you fail to persuade them, you won’t be able to check on the hostages, and you’ll have to enter through the rear entrance of the GilBank.</p><p>Once you’ve convinced the leader, head inside the Gilbank. Defeat the Shaw Gang, and search the leader’s body for the GalBank Front Door Key.</p><p>Use this key to unlock the front door and return to Marshal Blake for your reward.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_To_Sneak_Into_the_Bank_in_Starfield>How To Sneak Into the Bank in Starfield</span></h2><p>If negotiations with the bank robbers prove unsuccessful, Marshal Blake has provided a key for entry through GalBank’s rear entrance.</p><p>Head around the building to locate the back door and prepare yourself for a gunfight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-sneak-into-the-bank-1024x576.jpg><p>As you take down the Shaw Gang members, make your way to the lower-level vault to secure the safety of the hostages.</p><p>The vault will contain at least two bandits who are guarding the hostages.</p><p>Before wiping them out, it is important to check your aim to avoid hitting any hostage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-job-gone-wrong-mission-shaw-gang-member-1024x576.jpg><p>In the Job Gone Wrong mission, there are several possible outcomes, but shooting a hostage is the worst-case scenario. Therefore, it is important not to recklessly fire your weapon when entering the vault.</p><p>After defeating the all Shaw Gang members, loot the leader’s body for the key to the GalBank Front Door and return to Marshal Blake to get your reward.</p><p>And that’s how you complete the Job Gone Wrong in Starfield and unlock the next Freestar Collective faction mission called <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Deputized</a>.</p><p>Feel free to visit our <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Wiki Hub Page</a> for more helpful guides about the game.</p><p>Hello, Space Explorer, and welcome to our Starfield Wiki and Strategy Guide Hub, covering everything you need to know in the most expected video game of 2023.</p><p>Formally announced during Bethesda’s E3 presentation in 2018, Starfield is the biggest and most ambitious project coming from the award-winning creators of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4.</p><p>Featuring more than 1,000 planets, Starfield is an action role-playing game offering unparalleled freedom from character creation to exploration, crafting, and researching.</p><p>Our Starfield Wiki Hub includes guides covering the trickiest quests you may encounter while exploring the universe developed by Bethesda Game Studios.
