He sees HBO Max as a strong addition to any streaming platform and believes it would be tremendous to have all of AEW’s content available there. However, the final decision may ultimately be influenced by Warner Bros, which holds a significant stake in AEW.</p><p>“We have all the bones for a really strong streaming platform. It would be a very strong addition to any streaming platform, and my dream is that it all lands on Max. It would be tremendous. Right now, AEW All Access is available on Max, which is very cool, and hopefully, that is a step in the right direction, getting our stuff steaming. We have a great library. “</p><p>“All together, with everything I own, it’s thousands of hours of great wrestling and the AEW catalog has grown so much considering we started this thing from scratch four years ago. I believe the streaming service will happen. As to where it is and what platform it is, that’s something that I believe largely will be influenced by Warner Bros.”</p><p>Currently, past ROH content can be accessed on HonorClub, while AEW archived content is available internationally through FITE. However, Tony Khan’s goal is to have a dedicated AEW streaming service, and he remains optimistic that it will happen in the future.</p><p>As AEW continues to grow and expand its library, a streaming platform would provide fans with easy access to their favorite wrestling content from the promotion.</p><p>What are your thoughts on the possibility of AEW landing on a streaming platform like HBO Max?
