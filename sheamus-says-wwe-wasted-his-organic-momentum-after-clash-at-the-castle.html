The Celtic Warrior has almost done it all when it comes to being a WWE Superstar, but his stock isn’t as high as it used to be. It appears Sheamus stated that WWE wasted all the momentum he had after the Clash At The Castle event.</p><p>The Celtic Warrior worked very hard over the years and is a multi-time World Champion as well as a multi-time tag team champion. Despite being well over 40, Sheamus continues to perform at a high level.</p><p>Sheamus was unable to defeat Gunther at Clash At The Castle, where he challenged The Ring General for the Intercontinental Championship. Even then, the match successfully revitalized Sheamus’ career and made him a huge star.</p><p>However, WWE failed to capitalize on his momentum since then. While speaking with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Star</a>, Sheamus stated that he feels WWE wasted all the momentum he had after the Clash At The Castle event.</p><p>“I’m not upset about that at all (losing to GUNTHER at WWE Clash at the Castle). I felt it was great, it was just the type of character Sheamus is, all fits and elbows. What I was upset about and what really bothered me was the creative after that. I came out of that with so much organic momentum, and it was just wasted. It didn’t go anywhere. It was a dead end, just like with WrestleMania. Drew (McIntyre) went away because he was injured, but I was ready to go and then just nothing. There were no avenues and nowhere to go and that’s frustrating. I did the WarGames thing but that was s*** – that’s how I felt, though others might have felt differently.”</p><p>Sheamus will be competing in the Slim Jim Battle Royal at SummerSlam this week, but nothing else seems planned for him right now. We’ll have to wait and see whether WWE will improve Sheamus’ booking eventually.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on what Sheamus said?
