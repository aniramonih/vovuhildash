This year, they wanted to show off their family AND highlight some charities. So here is their Christmas card photo, and our first-ever glimpse of baby Lilibet Diana. Lili looks like a very happy, smiley baby who also might have red (or reddish) hair. LOOK AT ARCHIE!! Look at his full head of carrot!!! I love this family so much. Now, does this look like a denim ad? Yes, but I love it. I particularly love Meghan‚Äôs sweater!!</p><p>The Sussexes are highlighting some different charities this year, not just their patronages from a few years ago. <a href=#>Team Rubicon</a> is disaster-relief, <a href=#>Paid Leave for All</a> is the paid-family leave organization Meghan has been working with this year, etc. It‚Äôs a great boost to all of these charities and organizations to be included on the Sussexes‚Äô Christmas list.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A simple but meaningful digital Christmas card from Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan and their Archewell team this year.
