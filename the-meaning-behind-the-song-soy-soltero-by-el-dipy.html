El Dipy starts the song by rallying all the single people, asking them to raise their hands. He continues by jokingly telling the married folks to leave the party. This playful banter sets the tone for the rest of the song.</p><p>El Dipy then goes on to describe the joys of being single. He expresses his love for a carefree life, where he doesn’t have to work or study because he simply doesn’t want to. It’s a lighthearted ode to freedom and the absence of responsibilities.</p><p>In the next verse, El Dipy confronts the shallow societal pressure of being attractive. He embraces his perceived “ugliness” and proudly proclaims that he doesn’t care about being good-looking. He even assures the ladies that despite his appearance, he can still rock their world. It’s a refreshing take on self-acceptance and challenging beauty standards.</p><p>The chorus repeats the mantra of the single life, reinforcing the idea that being unattached brings endless possibilities for fun and enjoyment.
