Happy birthday Ben Stiller! The renowned actor turns 57 on November 30. The &#34;Zoolander&#34; star has reason to celebrate this year because he recently also got back with his ex-wife, Christine Taylor, after what seemed to be the end of their marriage.
The couple separated back in 2017 after spending 18 years together. However, even after announcing their split, the two were often still in each other's company while caring for their kids, and it seems they never really stopped loving each other."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That way, he could still see his kids during the lockdown. So, the actor and Taylor spent even more time together, and they slowly grew closer again.

He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/ben-stiller-christine-taylor-giving-marriage-another-shot-exclusive/>reportedly</a> "never got over" Christine and did all he could to show her he could be the guy she wanted him to be.

There's nothing you can do about it, but I did not encourage it."</p><p class=dh>The "Secret Life of Walter Mitty" actor also said he was unbelievably proud of his daughter on the set of "Escape to Dannemora." He wasn't sure how the father-daughter dynamic would work, but she handled it professionally.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>The apartment stretches over an entire floor and offers an impressive view of the Manhattan river.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/42571ea1f6a09536867689e2d1c62a65.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ben Stiller with Christine Taylor and their children at the hand and footprint ceremony honoring Stiller held at TCL Chinese Theatre on December 3, 2013 in Hollywood, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Stiller and Taylor's younger child, Quinlin, isn't as fond of the spotlight as his sister. He hasn't been seen in public often, and he steers clear of most events. His first real public outing was an A.L.S. benefit in 2018.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>They Lived in an Apartment That Occupied an Entire Floor</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In 2016, Stiller and his wife decided to move into a more-than-spacious apartment where they could comfortably bring up their two young kids. Located in New York's West Village, the house is a 3,400-square-foot marvel.</p><p class=dh>The apartment stretches over an entire floor and offers an impressive view of the Manhattan river. Decorated with hardwood paneling and floors, the home provides a luxurious setting in the heart of the city.</p><p class=dh>Impressive floor-to-ceiling windows offer enough light to make the home a sunny retreat. The hot tub, plunge pool, and lap pool give a range of options for relaxation, and with a built-in gym, there's no reason not to stay fit.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/ben-stiller-west-village-home>The house</a> has four bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom. There's also a study to accommodate any quiet, reflective work that needs to be done. The open-plan living room also has space for a dining room and has excellent views of the city.</p><p class=dh>The kitchen has the same hardwood decal as the rest of the house, paired with walnut wood and beautiful white-marble countertops. The property even has ample outdoor space for the kids to enjoy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/3f91c4082ace4fcc492a17062dae337e.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor's 2016 home | Source: Youtube.com/TODAY</p><p class=dh>There's even a private lobby to accommodate any waiting guests.
