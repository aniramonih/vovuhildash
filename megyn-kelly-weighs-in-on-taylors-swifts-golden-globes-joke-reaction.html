After the joke, the camera cut to Swift, who was wearing a deadpan expression and silently sipping her champagne.</p><p>“As you know, we came on after a football double header. The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? On the Golden Globes we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift,” Koy said on Sunday, January 7. After a mixed reaction from the audience, he added, “Sorry about that.”</p><p>Swift has recently made headlines for her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> — and the NFL’s frequent television coverage of her watching his games in private suites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Megyn-Kelly-Calls-Taylor-Swifts-Viral-Golden-Globes-Joke-Reaction-the-%E2%80%98Wrong-Move3.jpg><p>“Can’t [Taylor] just show that she’s a good sport?” Kelly said on Monday. “I think she made the wrong move.”</p><p>Kelly went on to defend Swift’s presence at the football games while maintaining that the singer’s reaction to the joke was not “smart.”</p><p>“[The joke] was a gentle swipe. And by the way, she’s not in charge of the number of times the NFL chooses to put her on cam. That’s not her fault. It is annoying,” Kelly said. “If she were smart, she would laugh like she was in on the joke.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift has <a href=#>previously addressed</a> her presence at Kelce’s games and the subsequent NFL coverage, telling TIME last month, “There’s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don’t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don’t know if I’m being shown 17 times or once.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Megyn-Kelly-Calls-Taylor-Swifts-Viral-Golden-Globes-Joke-Reaction-the-%E2%80%98Wrong-Move2.jpg><p>Koy <a href=#>told Entertainment Tonight</a> on Sunday that the joke was all in good fun. “Aw, man, it was cute. I was just saying it was cute,” he said. “I was just saying it’s less cutaways, that’s all.”</p><p>Koy <a href=#>further clarified</a> his intention to GMA3 on Monday. “I was trying to make fun of the NFL using cutaways and how the Globes didn’t have to do that,” he said. “So, it was more of a jab toward the NFL. But it just didn’t come out that way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSen6mjeqyxy6WwZq%2BVnrSpv4yipWannmLBosXLqKmsZaOstqfA0maeqKSUmrtus8uomZ6rXZ%2B8rLGMq5yam6SevK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./172245-meet-polly-jordan-everything-jim-jordans-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Polly Jordan: Everything we know about Jim Jordan's wife</span></a>
