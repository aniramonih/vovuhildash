On the latest episode of Ric Flair Wooooo Nation Uncensored, co-host Mark Madden asks Ric about Lee being the surprise contender in the Face of Revolution qualifier on the 2/9 edition of AEW Dynamite.</p><p>“I like him personally,” Flair said before citing WWE’s handling of Lee. “My take is they could never figure out what to do with his character.”</p><p>While Keith sure got a reaction, from a star standpoint the surprise that Ric believed would really pack a punch was another former WWE star. “Not taking anything away from Keith Lee, but a big surprise to me would have been Bray Wyatt,” he said.</p><p>Either way, the numbers for that Dynamite made it the most-watched program on cable and the Nature Boy made note of that.</p><p>“Here’s the deal, they got a hell of a rating Wednesday night?” Madden pushed back at that wondering if the reveal of Lee would garner ratings in for the following week (the 2/16 Dynamite did come in with an 839,000 viewership), but Flair was keeping tabs on Tony Khan’s main agenda.</p><p>“The point I’m making is RAW got a 1.3 so the goal is to try and catch RAW or still is what Tony [Khan’s] goal is. For whatever it clicked I hope they can keep it going and I hope for the wrestling fans that they see and look and try to understand how hard it is to get over in this business. It’s going to take Keith years as it does anybody to get over.”</p><p>Madden inquired about Lee’s age, noting that Keith is 37 which Ric wasn’t aware of.</p><p>“It just makes the task even tougher,” Flair said, “Because in this day and age you’re judged every day by your age, your weight, your height, the number of people you wrestled. It doesn’t matter how good at football you were at Texas A&M now it’s just how you’re perceived by the audience. For me personally, he’s a respectable nice kid.”</p><p>You can hear the full discussion on the latest episode of Wooooo Nation which is below:</p><p>Transcription credit should go to of WrestleZone</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFxaGlpYGK%2Fqq%2BMn6OaoaJiuKa106FkpZ2VYq6osYyanLA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./161747-peter-gunz-takes-daughters-beach-online-html.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Gunz Takes Daughters to the Beach after Online Clash with Amina Buddafly &amp;amp; New Man</span></a>
