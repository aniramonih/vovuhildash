Josh Flagg's 'Million Dollar Listing' pup George cost close to $30,000 and has been keeping Flagg and husband Bobby Boyd on their toes ever since he arrived. Not only has he eaten drywall and urinated on an expensive rug, he was recently 'fired' by the dog walker.

However, Flagg reports that George, who he spent close to $30,000 to adopt, managed to eat the drywall in his home and urinate on a $40,000 rug.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-josh-flagg-says-george-was-fired-from-his-dogwalker>Josh Flagg says George was ‘fired’ from his dogwalker</h2><p id=par-3_48>Flagg spilled about George on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Berning in Hell</a> podcast. “By the way, my dog is a psycho,” he said. “He ate the baseboard in my house this morning.” Adding, “His name is George. [But] he ate another dog! He was actually just fired from his dog walker.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-4_98>“I just got home right before the podcast,” Flagg said. “And the dog walker I had to talk to. And he goes, ‘I have to fire George.’ I go ‘Why?’ He goes, ‘He bit another dog today.’ I’m like, ‘Impossible. George is the sweetest, fluffiest animal.'” But the dog walker insisted he couldn’t control George. “And literally this dog had 30 weeks of training,” Flagg exclaimed. “The dog should have been able to come back from the trainer and f**king like programmed a website. I thought this dog was going to be so smart. Like, write Javascript, right?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-josh-flagg-spent-about-30-000-to-adopt-this-million-dollar-listing-dog>Josh Flagg spent about $30,000 to adopt this ‘Million Dollar Listing’ dog</h2><p id=par-5_39>“This dog literally is so dumb,” Flagg continued. “He ate the drywall yesterday. He is right now chewing on my foot. And I’m really considering sending him back. What dog gets fired? He <a href=#>ate the drywall</a>! Who eats drywall?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_76>Host Hannah Berner joked that George was trying to poison himself to get out. “Like literally I’m so pissed,” Flagg added. “He f**king pissed on a $40,000 rug. I’m so unhappy about it. I’m really unhappy because this dog was really <a href=#>close to $30,000</a>. If this dog was like I rescued him at the shelter and he was like $300 for a vaccination or a shot and we’re good to go, I wouldn’t be so pissed.”</p><p id=par-7_20>“But this dog, I was sold a bad bill of goods,” he said. “He doesn’t even know his name!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-george-trick-josh-flagg-into-adopting-him>Did George trick Josh Flagg into adopting him?</h2><p id=par-8_71>Flagg was so in love with Tutor’s dog he went to the same breeder in Alabama to adopt George. Unfortunately, he’s having a different experience. “My friend Tracy who is on the show has a dog, which is from the same breeder and is, by the way, perfect,” he said. “And I went to Alabama to get this dog. I flew there … didn’t like the first dog. Flew home.</p><p id=par-9_46>“Flew out again. And then this dog was so well behaved,” he recalled about George. “Beautiful, such a sweet dog. I didn’t realize he was the devil.” Flagg laughed thinking how the breeder probably laughed as he flew away with George calling him a “sucker.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CTVu6-4FUAl/</p></figure><p id=par-10_40>“By the way, <a href=#>he was returned</a> by another dog owner,” Flagg said. “Now I know why. They said the family was allergic. Then I was thinking about it, this is the most hypoallergenic dog …it’s now all coming together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qrjLoqanZZSkua2t0Wajoquknruov4yjpqygXZu5orPGZpurp6ClsqV5kmlnaWhdmbyoecCtnGacoq7EorjLZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-millie-bobby-brown-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Millie Bobby Brown Parents: Meet Kelly And Robert</span></a>
