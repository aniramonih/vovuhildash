While neither Holker nor the&nbsp;<i>Magic Mike XXL&nbsp;</i>actor won their initial seasons, they both came back as “All-Star” mentors — and <a href=#>enjoyed getting to work together</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Over the years, we’ve done so much but the common denominator and the thought line has always been, like, joy and laughter and love, for sure,” Boss gushed in a joint February 2022 <a href=#>YouTube</a> video with his wife, recapping their favorite duets. “So, even looking back at all these things that we were blessed enough to do, it’s, like, I think it came from as much light as we’re putting in the world.”</p><p class=p1>Holker and Boss — who share son <a href=#>Maddox</a>, born in 2016, and daughter <a href=#>Zaia</a>, born in 2019, as well as the Minnesota native’s <a href=#>daughter Weslie</a> from a previous relationship — also took their growing romance to new heights when <a href=#>they began working together</a>. <i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>exclusively confirmed in November 2017 that the married pair would host Freeform’s&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Disney’s Fairy Tale Weddings&nbsp;</i></a>and&nbsp;<i>Disney’s Fairy Tale Weddings: Holiday Magic.&nbsp;</i>The docuseries, which ran between 2017 and 2020, saw Holker and Boss — <a href=#>who later adopted Weslie</a> — copresent the program about Disney-held nuptials.</p><p class=p1>“Our wedding is one of my favorite moments of my life,” the <a href=#>HGTV personality told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at the time</a>. “It’s such a special moment that I got to share with my husband. When they asked us to be a part of&nbsp;<i>Disney’s Fairy Tale Weddings</i>, I was honored to be a part of someone else’s moment that they’ll remember forever. It’s so special. It just seemed&nbsp;like a magical moment.”</p><p class=p1>Amid growing careers, Holker and Boss continued to dance together — even <a href=#>during the contemporary dancer’s pregnancies</a> with Maddox and Zaia.</p><p class=p1>“My best advice is to find a dance partner that you trust and you love. For me, that’s my beautiful wife, Allison,” he said during an October 2019 episode of&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i></a>. “Listen, she is 9 months pregnant, <a href=#>she is my hero</a>, she’s here and we’re about to groove like only Bosses can do!”</p><p class=p1>The former&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>&nbsp;</i>DJ and the<a href=#>&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Flirty Dancing</a>&nbsp;</i>choreographer further showcased their dance moves via social media.</p><p class=p1>“A moment with my HUS&nbsp;@sir_twitch_alot&nbsp;!&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>,” Holker quipped via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in May 2022, sharing footage of the twosome dancing in their backyard.</p><p class=p1>Boss <a href=#>died the following December at the age of 40</a> of an apparent suicide. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share my husband Stephen has left us,” Holker <a href=#>said in a statement at the time</a>. “Stephen lit up every room he stepped into. He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She continued: “Stephen, we love you, we miss you, and I will always save the last dance for you.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for more of the pair’s sweetest quotes about working — and dancing — together:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrq24yKymp2WYpLmssdFmqq2doJ2yr3nTsKCtm5hir7C%2F0maorqekmsBuu81mrqiqm567qHnTqJ6erJiav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1410781-adam-copeland-recalls-the-various-measures-taken-to-his-aew-debut-a-surprise.html><span>←</span><span>Adam Copeland Recalls The Various Measures Taken To His AEW Debut A Surprise</span></a>
