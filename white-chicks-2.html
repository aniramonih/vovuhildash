Here’s all we know so far regarding a White Chicks 2 sequel.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>The Wayans Brothers Have Teased The Sequel For Years</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>The Wayans brothers have indicated interest in developing a sequel to White Chicks since its publication. Marlon Wayans told MTV News in 2009 that they had a script for White Chicks 2 and were waiting for Sony Pictures to approve it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, nothing came of it, and the sequel was shelved. Marlon Wayans posted a photo of himself and Shawn dressed as the white women on Instagram in 2015, with the message “Show of hands who wants to see the sequel to this?” With 300,000 likes, I’m thinking about making this our next film.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/White-Chicks-2-1.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>Although the post gained over 400,000 likes, no formal statement was made. Terry Crews, who played Latrell Spencer in the original film, revealed to Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in 2019 that White Chicks 2 was in the works and that he had spoken with Shawn Wayans about it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He went on to say, “You know what? I got with Shawn, and he was like ‘Man, we’re doing it, we’re getting it going'”. However, Marlon Wayans later confirmed on Instagram that White Chicks 2 was not currently in the works and that they were still awaiting studio approval.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>A Fake Poster Went Viral In 2023</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>A bogus ad for White Chicks 2 became popular on social media in May 2023, sparking a lot of enthusiasm among fans. The white chicks were played by Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and the tagline was “Back in the Habit.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to the poster, the sequel will be released on July 4, 2023. Marlon Wayans, on the other hand, swiftly discredited the billboard on Instagram, commenting, “Not real. AT ALL!” He also stated that he would be interested in doing White Chicks 2 if he and Shawn were involved.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“If we do White Chicks, it’s gotta be me and Shawn… we’ll see,” he stated. I don’t release it into the universe because I don’t have control over it. However, I would make a sequel to White Chicks. That is my opinion, and I would return to the Scary Movie franchise.”</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>The Potential Plot And Cast Of White Chicks 2</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>While no official narrative or cast for White Chicks 2 has been announced, fans have speculated about what the sequel could be about. Some speculate that the film would follow the Wayans brothers as they disguise themselves as various types of women, such as celebrities, influencers, or politicians.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Others have suggested that the film explore the ramifications of their previous impersonations, such as litigation, scandals, or vengeance. The Wayans brothers, who play Kevin and Marcus Copeland, are expected to return, as is Terry Crews, who plays Latrell Spencer.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Other cast members from the first film, including Busy Philipps, Jaime King, John Heard, and Frankie Faison, may return for the sequel. In addition, some new faces, such as Tiffany Haddish, Kevin Hart, or Leslie Jones, who are known for their comedic abilities, could join the group.</p><p><strong>To find additional information about the release dates of other new movies and TV shows, refer to the following posts:</strong></p><ul><li class="code-block code-block-1"><a href=#>Beetlejuice 2 Release Date: Everything You Need to Know About the Long-Awaited Sequel</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Bloody Escape Release Date: A New Anime Film by Goro Taniguchi</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>The Possible Release Date Of White Chicks 2</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>There is no definitive release date for White Chicks 2 because it has not been officially confirmed or greenlit by Sony Pictures. <strong>However, if work begins in 2023, the film could be released by the end of 2024, according to certain reports.</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Terry Crews says White Chicks 2 is officially in the works: <a href=#>https://t.co/P9xmHxquns</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wXQ0hOyXMD</a></p><p>— CONSEQUENCE (@consequence) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 2, 2019</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, because these are speculations rather than actual statements, fans should take them with a grain of salt.
