(Supposedly, this has left him so emotionally wounded that he’s <a href=#>putting off marrying Gwen Stefani because of Miranda</a>)</p><p>Of course, there were reports that Blake had also cheated on Miranda … but it appears that most of the Country Music subculture sided with Blake.</p><p>Anyway, it was over being cheated on that Gwen and Blake first bonded, after Gwen told her costars on The Voice about what had happened.</p><p>(Gwen might be a celebrity, but Gavin Rossdale was only her second-ever serious relationship, so cheating is a very big deal to her.

(Though that’s been encouraged by things like <a href=#>Blake Shelton’s non-subtle wedding song</a>)</p><p>For another, we’ve heard stories about them breaking up that, for better or for worse, didn’t pan out.</p><p>But now the stories of the two of them taking a stab at pregnancy are looking a lot realer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>InTouch Weekly reports that <a href=#>Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton are trying to get pregnant</a>.</p><p>(They also report that Gavin Rossdale is getting super bitter about Blake’s role in the lives of his children, so this is unlikely to improve things)</p><p>This claim is further supported by Blake Shelton himself.</p><p>Blake was promoting his clothing line (titled "BS," which are his initials but … he could have gone in a different direction with that) earlier this month when a fan asked him if he and Gwen were going to have any kids.</p><p>"I hope. We will see."</p><p>He could have just told the fan that it was none of their business.</p><p>So … they’re not even keeping it a secret anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Gwen Stefani is 48, folks.</p><p>She was 42 when she had her youngest, but … a lot can change in a person’s body in six years.</p><p>Sure, the two of them are trying, but there’s no guarantee that she and the alleged "Sexiest Man Alive" can produce a baby.</p><p>You’d think that they’d just adopt, especially since a pregnancy at Gwen’s age could produce serious risks for her and for the baby, but apparently Blake wants a biological child.</p><p>And apparently Gwen is so besotted that she’s willing to go along with it.</p><p>Let’s hope that this doesn’t end in tragedy.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani: 11 Most Adorable PDA Moments</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z%2BcK7LmqKeZaOdsq3AzqdkoqVdqb%2B6tc2gZK2nXZyytXnGsJynZaOpsqetzaJkqaqVnLuiutNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-andrew-birthday-queens-plans-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>How the Queen will be spending Prince Andrew's 60th birthday</span></a>
