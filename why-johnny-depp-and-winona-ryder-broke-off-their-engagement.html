By the time Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp got engaged, they had both heard that a million times, so in an attempt to avoid the invasive eye of the paparazzi, they adopted a different strategy — one of truth and openness. However, after the relationship ended, it was clear they had made a mistake.</p><p>"It's very hard to have a personal life in this town," Depp told the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> after their split in 1993. "My relationship with Winona, it was my mistake to be as open as we were, but I thought if we were honest it would destroy that curiosity monster."&nbsp;Not a bad idea, but it ultimately garnered negative results. "Instead it fed it, gave people license to feel they were part of it," Depp explained.&nbsp;</p><p>While we will never know what happened between them in private, the public's demand for the intimate details of their life together didn't do their relationship any favors.&nbsp;The two still seem to respect each other, however. Ryder <a href=#>spoke up on Depp's behalf</a> in 2020 after ex-wife Amber Heard claimed he was abusive. As for the tattoo? Now it says <a href=#>"WINO FOREVER."</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29haH93e9ahsGain527r8WMnZypqF2Wu6V51qKlqKaRYr%2B6sMSrZJuqn6CybrvFn2StoJWev26xzaCYoJ2dmru1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-virlan-garcia-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Virlan Garcia Dating Now? -Past Relationships, Current Relationship Status, Rumours, and Fact</span></a>
