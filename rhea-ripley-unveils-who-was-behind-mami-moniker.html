Her dedication to the business helped her become a megastar, especially after she got her ‘Mami’ moniker. Now she has revealed the person who came up with the name in the first place.</p><p>Rhea Ripley has adopted the moniker “Mami,” a play on Eddie Guerrero’s use of “Papi,” which gained significance during his feud with Rey Mysterio. In their rivalry, Eddie asserted himself as the “papi” of a young Dominik Mysterio. To provoke Rey Mysterio, Ripley wore an “I’m Your Papi” shirt and later transformed it into “I’m Your Mami.”</p><p>While speaking on the <a href=#>NotSamWrestling</a>, Rhea Ripley talked about how the ‘Mami’ moniker came to be. Ripley revealed that it was ultimately Damian Priest’s idea, as she couldn’t call herself ‘Papi.’</p><p>“[Mami] was a Priest thing. I went out there, came back after kneeing myself in the face and busting my front two teeth, I had braces for a week, it was great. I came back from that, and we came back on Rey’s anniversary. That’s where I decided to be a little menace, be myself, and I ordered an Eddie Guerrero shirt and I came out with ‘I’m Your Papi’ shirt, just to see what the hell was going to happen from that.”</p><p>”That was a me call and just me doing something that I thought was right and I wanted to stir the pot a little bit. I started the whole Papi thing, I got told I couldn’t be Papi, so Priest was like, ‘Well, you’re Mami.’ I was like, ‘Damn straight I’m Mami. We’re going to roll with that.’ The Mami thing makes me feel comfortable. I just got out there and I’m a child version of myself. I go out there, have fun, do little menace things, make fun of people. Just going out there and having fun</p><p>Rhea Ripley also admitted that things between herself and <a href=#>Dominik Mysterio were awkward at first</a>. Her match for the&nbsp;<a href=#>Elimination Chamber Premium Live Event</a>&nbsp;was more or less confirmed after Nia Jax attacked her on RAW last week as well, so we’ll have to see how their feud will be booked till then.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on this story?
