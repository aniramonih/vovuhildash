The same can’t be said for Crowley, though, who despite being pulverized by an airplane jet engine, is still expected to return for future Hatchet movies."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Or so says franchise architect Adam Green, who spoke to Bloody Disgusting in anticipation of&nbsp;Hatchet‘s premiere on the UK’s dedicated Horror Channel, stating:</p><p>A major reason why the Hatchet sequels have succeeded is that they were planned out from the very start. In the first film, I actually showed some of the weapons that Victor Crowley wouldn’t actually use until the later films and I held back crucial elements of his mythology to be revealed later on down the road. Of course, it was also a risky move given that there was no way of knowing if I’d ever get to make the sequels.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Victor-Crowley-1-670x345.jpg alt="Victor Crowley" width=640 height=330 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>So it’s nigh on certain that Adam Green will be venturing into Crowley’s famous swamp in the not-so-distant future, and that’s despite the most recent Victor Crowley movie being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">torn to shreds by critics</a> – not unlike the fate that befell&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kane Hodder’s titular abomination</a>.</p><p data-characters=16 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Green continued:</p><p>Originally I had only planned for Hatchet to be a trilogy, but when I decided to bring Victor Crowley back for more I planned out another complete roadmap for where it could all go. I’ve been able to stay in love with Victor Crowley because I only head back into his swamp when I’m ready to do so. Given that Hatchet is a cult franchise and not a studio property, my crew and I have always been able to make each film only when we want to.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=false>Clearly the fourth entry in Green’s Hatchet series is a tale that grew in the telling, but what do you think about the inevitable resurrection of <strong>Victor Crowley</strong>? You can, as always, drop your thoughts, comments and predictions in the usual place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomJ2ZnWK0s7HEp2Scp56btqWxza1kr6GTqbyzecKrprCkla56uLXLpWSaqKCarrN5yKdkn62kqr%2Bmeceaq5yglal6rrvVopysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adam-dangelo-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Adam DAngelo Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating,Bio-Wiki</span></a>
