Nick is technically dead, but that’s never stopped someone from coming back to Days before!</p><p>Although it’s possible Berris will play someone new, it seems like there’d be more value in having him play Nick with all his family connections and twisted history. That’s especially true if Nick’s part of Gabi Hernandez’s (Camila Banus) exit storyline.</p><p>Berris popped up at Deidre Hall’s 5,000th episode celebration, so he may have already been filming when Camila Banus wrapped up her final scenes in April.</p><p>If that’s the case, Nick might play a role in the drama that awaits Gabi and Stefan DiMera (Brandon Barash).</p><p>DOOL fans know Nick was previously obsessed with Gabi, who felt she’d never escape his fixated, abusive grasp.</p><p>It drove Gabi to shoot Nick dead, which landed her in prison for a while.</p><p>Of course, Gabi is a free woman now – and Nick may not be so dead after all!</p><p>It’s common for deceased Salemites to make miraculous recoveries, so what if Nick returns and targets Gabi?</p><p>Nick might want revenge or perhaps he’ll just want a second chance at romance. It could even turn out to be a mixture of both if Nick’s motives change along the way.</p><p>Regardless, Sami Brady (Allison Sweeney) previously got an exit where Lucas Horton (Bryan Dattilo) held her hostage, which left her all tied up and off canvas for quite some time.</p><p>Could Days take a similar route with Gabi’s departure? It’s possible Gabi will find herself being held captive somewhere by Nick in the end.</p><p>Perhaps Nick could fake Gabi’s death so that no one will go looking for her, especially Stefan since we know he’ll remain on Days after Gabi’s departure.</p><p>If Gabi gets a captivity exit, it’ll leave the door open for her return – either through Banus’ comeback or a possible Gabi recast.</p><p>It would also give Nick a secret to keep if he’s roaming around Salem again while holding Gabi at some undisclosed location.</p><p>Nick could easily rise from the grave somehow – and if that happens, will he steal Stefan’s love?</p><p>Nick could take matters into his own hands and hold Gabi against her will, so stay tuned for updates on how his return news might affect things.</p><p>Days of Our Lives spoilers say Gabi has some disastrous developments in her future no matter what.</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for sizzling <a href=# rel=noopener>Days of Our Lives spoilers, news and updates, so make us your top DOOL source.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnlJbGtHnOn2SoraJiuarCxKxkrKifnrmmvtJmpaKbm2KzorjLqKVmoJ%2BhsbR5xpqZomWYpMC1rcaeZKuho5rAbrLRqKRmrJiaeqi%2BwK%2BcZqyfYsC1scClZKyslZuur7%2BMpaavnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./30824443-young-sheldon-season-5-what-happened.html><span>←</span><span>Young Sheldon Season 5...what happened?</span></a>
