A 9-year-old child died. And, you know, everything changed from that and, you know, I still have trouble talking about it, obviously, so if I get emotional, I apologize,” the 47-year-old began on the Tuesday, May 21, episode of <a href=#>“The Only One in the Room” podcast.</a> “And that, you know, changed me. And, luckily, I came out the other side and really positive things have happened in my life since then.”</p><p>Cruz Jr. died from injuries a day after the June 2001 accident. While Gayheart paid for the little boy’s funeral and settled a wrongful death suit filed by the his parents in 2002, she admitted on the podcast that she still struggles with the incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rebecca-Gayheart-Suicidal-Fatal-Car-Accident.jpg><p>“I struggle with the ‘Why?’ still,” the Beverly Hills, 90210&nbsp;actress explained. “I still replay it in my head of, ‘Had I stopped at the gas station, maybe I wouldn’t have been on that street.’ You know, those things never go away — they stay with you forever and I did not cope very well after. … Listen, I just didn’t want to live after that accident.”</p><p>Gayheart added that she “spent about a year” after the accident trying to kill herself “by doing every self-destructive thing” she could do.</p><p>“I just didn’t understand; I didn’t understand any of it, like, I had led, you know, sort of a charmed life up until then, even though I grew up dirt poor,” she said, noting that she had a great career, family and friends. “It just turned my world upside down and I lost faith in everything, like, I questioned God, like, ‘Why me? Why Jorge?’”</p><p>While Gayheart still asks herself those questions, she is in a better place now.</p><p>“Today, I am able to ponder those questions and still realize that I deserve to be happy,” she concluded. “That I am meant to be on this planet and that I have a purpose and I’m making, living amends for that, even though it was an accident.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star shares <a href=#>daughters</a> Billie, 9, and Georgia, 7, with her ex <a href=#><strong>Eric Dane</strong></a>.
