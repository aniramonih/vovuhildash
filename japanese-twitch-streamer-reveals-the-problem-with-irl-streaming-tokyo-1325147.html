She then recalled how the government in Tokyo was talking about potentially banning livestreaming in public.</p><p>While the government didn’t ban IRL broadcasts, it’s still frowned upon and a lot of places simply won’t allow it.</p><p>“Many, many places say ‘no camera’,” she revealed. “When I’m streaming outside, you guys saw that.”</p><p>[ad name=”article3″]</p><p>As it turned out, in the past, SAKURA had been asked to leave places when attempting to broadcast. “If it’s live-streaming, it’s going to happen. But if it’s YouTube, I can ask in advance ‘can I bring my camera?’”</p><p>So, while IRL broadcasting Japan on Twitch may be difficult for many Japanese people, they’re more likely to create content specifically for YouTube or other video platforms.</p><p>It’s certainly interesting to think about how this affects content for Japanese entertainers such as SAKURA. However, as she said, for non-locals visiting the country, it seems like they’re free to livestream as they please.</p><p>So far, Senpai isn’t doing too bad for herself in 2020 having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just passed the 15,000 follower mark</a> on Twitch. Hopefully for her, the rest of the year can maintain this growth – even without IRL streams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbHXnqmtp16YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iikaWur7HSnmStr5mpsKl50q2pnpmdmr9uvsSvnJqko2LBqbGMqamompyaum7DyK2fZqGioXq0wNGemKahnpx6tbvKsqZmaWNngnKAlmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-lynn-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Jamie Lynn Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
