Divided to its very core,Oppenheimer is an intensely subjective character study of a genius defined by contradictions as well as a sprawling origin story about the birth of the modern world. For its opening two-thirds, the film builds at a breakneck pace to the instant in which both man and civilization are irrevocably changed by an act of fission: the July 16, 1945, “Trinity” test of the first atomic bomb on the plains of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, 210 miles south of Los Alamos.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>J.D.
