Similar to&nbsp;Scooby-Doo and all its clones, this animated series featured a group driving around and getting into adventures. This was a golden age of Globetrotters, and team legends like Meadowlark Lemon and "Curly" Neal voiced their own characters.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1974, the Globetrotters made their way back to Saturday mornings with the live-action variety show The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine, which, like other mid-'70s shows of this style, featured corny comedy sketches and musical performances. Then the famous team returned to animated form once more in the bizarre 1979 cartoon <a href=#>The Super Globetrotters</a>, in which the already superhuman Globetrotters were imbued with special abilities. For example, Curly could transform himself into a basketball, while "Sweet" Lou Dunbar's afro held a bottomless supply of tools and gadgets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bj2lwa3FfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2ptaZ5x5qppZ2dYrStu8Geq6unpKmys7%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-gracias-by-jose-alfredo-jimenez.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Gracias. by Jos Alfredo Jimnez</span></a>
