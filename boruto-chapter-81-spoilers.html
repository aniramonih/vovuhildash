<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>What to Expect from the Timeskip</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Boruto Chapter 81 Spoilers Twitter, Reddit:-</strong> Boruto Chapter 81 is one of the most anticipated chapters of the manga series, as it will mark the beginning of a new era for the story. The previous chapter ended with a shocking twist, as Boruto decided to leave the Hidden Leaf Village with Sasuke, who had lost his Rinnegan in the battle against Jigen. Boruto was also infected by Momoshiki’s Karma, which threatened to take over his body and mind. The only way to stop this process was to train under Sasuke and learn how to control his Otsutsuki powers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kawaki, who had also received a Karma from Jigen, chose to stay in the village and protect Naruto, who was in a coma after being sealed by Jigen. Kawaki had developed a bond with Naruto and his family, and he felt guilty for betraying them by letting Jigen invade the village. He also vowed to get revenge on Jigen, who had tortured him and used him as a vessel for his resurrection.</p><p>The chapter ended with a mysterious voice saying “See you soon”, implying that a time skip will occur and that Boruto and Kawaki will meet again in the future. This has sparked a lot of speculation among fans, who are eager to see how the characters will change and grow during the time skip. Here are some of the spoilers and predictions for Boruto Chapter 81, based on the information available from various sources.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Borutos_Training_with_Sasuke></span>Boruto’s Training with Sasuke<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the main focuses of Boruto Chapter 81 will be Boruto’s training with Sasuke, who will act as his mentor and guide. Sasuke is one of the few people who can understand Boruto’s situation, as he also had a cursed mark from Orochimaru that gave him access to powerful abilities but also corrupted him. Sasuke will teach Boruto how to master his Karma and his Jougan, which is a unique eye that can see chakra and dimensions. Sasuke will also help Boruto develop his own fighting style and ninjutsu, as well as his mental strength and resolve.</p><p>Boruto’s training with Sasuke will not be easy, as he will have to face many dangers and challenges along the way. He will also have to deal with Momoshiki’s influence, which will try to take over his body and mind at any moment. Boruto will have to resist Momoshiki’s temptation and prove that he is not a mere vessel, but a shinobi with his own will and identity.</p><p>Boruto’s training with Sasuke will also take him to different places and dimensions, where he will encounter new enemies and allies. He will learn more about the Otsutsuki clan and their history, as well as their plans for the world. He will also discover new secrets and mysteries about his own lineage and destiny.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kawakis_Life_in_the_Hidden_Leaf_Village></span>Kawaki’s Life in the Hidden Leaf Village<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another major aspect of Boruto Chapter 81 will be Kawaki’s life in the Hidden Leaf Village, where he will stay under the protection of Naruto’s family and friends. Kawaki will have to adjust to living in a peaceful and friendly environment, which is very different from his previous life as a test subject for Jigen. He will also have to cope with his guilt and trauma, as well as his fear of Jigen’s return.</p><p>Kawaki will form new bonds and relationships with the people in the village, especially Naruto’s children, Himawari and Boruto.
