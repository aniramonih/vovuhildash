(Yes, the world was in color, but just barely.) By 1971 the key personnel were in place, as was the now more familiar name. Their self-titled album debuted in 1972, says <a href=#>Louder Sound</a>, and they quickly earned a reputation as a sort of thinking person's progressive (except when they weren't) metal (except when they weren't) yet melodic (pretty much always were) group of rockers.

"I was thinking about the concept of an eternal love, one that transcends the borders of death," he said. The whole thing "just came to me," he said, but when he sat and thought about it, he realized he'd been sort of channeling the band Jethro Tull — "I wanted it to be so much more than a pop hit. ... I don't believe it would have been so enduring if it had just been a throwaway composition."</p><p>Endure it has, along with BOC.
