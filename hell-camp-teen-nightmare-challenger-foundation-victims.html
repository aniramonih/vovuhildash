"troubled teens," but the multi-billion dollar industry's controversial tactics often hurt more adolescents than they help.</p><p>Established by <a href=#>Steve Cartisano</a> in the late 1980s, the Challenger Foundation was a <a href=#>wilderness therapy camp</a> geared towards teenagers labeled as rebellious, delinquent, or worse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/teen-nightmare-cr-courtesy-netflix-868500378-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was the Challenger Foundation?</h2><p>In 1988, Steve Cartisano created the Challenger Foundation.</p><p>The organization centered around a <a href=#>wilderness survival program</a> for <a href=#>troubled teens and adolescents</a>.</p><p>As part of the Challenger program, teenagers were taken out of their beds in the middle of the night, and transported to the <a href=#>wilderness</a> of <a href=#>Utah</a>.</p><p>While it sounds like a <a href=#>kidnapping</a>, the teen's parents were not only privy to the experience, but they also shelled out big bucks to pay for it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More About Hell Camp">Read More About Hell Camp</h2><p>The average cost of the program was upwards of $15,900.</p><p>Parents would temporarily sign away their parental rights to their "troubled" teen, allowing Challenger staff members to come into their homes and whisk their child away for 63 days.</p><p>As described in the <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary, <a href=#>Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare</a>, the Challenger Foundation was founded to "transform bad kids through ordeal."</p><p>Teenagers would face "brutal conditions" during the camp, which claimed that "the kids are worn down until they're good again."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>While some called "the concept" behind the Challenger Foundation "remarkable," others questioned the legality and morality of taking children through such a traumatic experience "far beyond the reach of US authorities."</p><p>The ultimate goal of the Challenger Foundation was to use harsh techniques, like strenuous, manual labor, and <a href=#>discipline teens into submission</a>, obedience, and "goodness."</p><p>The <a href=#>boot camp-style approach</a> combined physical and mental training that many, if not all, of the teens were ill-equipped to handle.</p><p>The camp employed a myriad of techniques to encourage kids into compliance, including strip searches and <a href=#>military</a> haircuts.</p><p>Many of the teenagers were allegedly starved, and food was regularly withheld as "punishment" for bad behavior or non-compliance.</p><p>Teenagers were forced to hike for dozens of miles in the rocky, outdoor terrain, often in freezing temperatures and carrying heavy gear.</p><p>What started as a legitimate, <a href=#>therapeutic tool</a> quickly turned to controversy, as many former "students" alleged that they were <a href=#>physically and mentally abused </a>during the duration of the camp.</p><p>The majority of these claims were directed at the Challenger Foundation's unruly staff, and the organization's founder, Steve Cartisano.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was Steve Cartisano?</h2><p>Steve Cartisano was born on August 15, 1955, in Modesto, <a href=#>California</a>.</p><p>Before creating the Challenger Foundation, he worked as an <a href=#>Air Force</a> instructor and a <a href=#>military special forces officer</a>.</p><p>In 1978, he <a href=#>married</a> Deborah Lee Carr.</p><p>The couple would go on to have <a href=#>four children</a> together.</p><p>In 1988, Cartisano created the Challenger Foundation, intending to help <a href=#>troubled teens and adolescents</a> overcome their struggles with <a href=#>substance abuse</a>, <a href=#>mental health issues</a>, and <a href=#>behavioral disorders</a>.</p><p>According to <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">High Country News</a>, Cartisano's philosophy behind the Challenger Foundation was to "break the kids down and build them back up."</p><p>Using his military background, Cartisano would operate as the camp's "drill sergeant," forcing the camp's participants into listening to him and abiding by his rules – or else.</p><p>While some heralded Cartisano as a genius, the teenagers he "helped" would say otherwise.</p><p>As the camp's popularity (and profits) grew, Cartisano had to take on more and more staff.</p><p>These "camp counselors" were unfit or ill-equipped to deal with the teens they were trying to help, resulting in negligence, misconduct, and <a href=#>downright abuse</a>.</p><p>By the early 1990s, the Challenger Foundation was forced to shut down and <a href=#>declare bankruptcy</a> as a result of constant and consistent <a href=#>legal battles</a> between Cartisano and the camp's staff, and the camp's former campers and their parents.</p><p>While Cartisano ended up being banned from operating any type of "treatment" programs in Utah, he did try and replicate the Challenger Foundation in <a href=#>Hawaii</a>, <a href=#>Puerto Rico</a>, and the <a href=#>US Virgin Islands</a>.</p><p>None of the programs were ever licensed.</p><p>In the 2000s, Cartisano reportedly worked a dormitory supervisor on a reservation in <a href=#>Oklahoma</a>.</p><p>When a <a href=#>Bureau of Indian Affairs officer</a> found out about Cartisano's past, he fired him on the spot.</p><p>On May 4, 2019, Cartisano died at his home in Durant, Oklahoma, at the age of 63.</p><p>While he had reportedly been battling <a href=#>colon cancer</a> for a few years before his death, he ultimately passed away from an unexpected <a href=#>heart attack</a>.</p><p>Cartisano is survived by his wife, Deborah, their four children, and two grandchildren.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

camp?</h2><p>In the 2023 <a href=#>documentary</a>, Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare, former participants of the Challenger Foundation recount their experiences with the program.</p><p>Some of the students described being tied to trees for misbehaving, while others say they were forcibly "dragged" through the woods when stopping for a break on a hike.</p><p>As <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by Dexerto</a>, in one of the documentary's key moments, a witness recalls seeing the teens firsthand: “They were emaciated, they were dirty. You couldn’t even tell that they were kids.”</p><p>Another witness remembers a doctor who reportedly “counted over 80 scars, marks, and contusions” on one of the camp's attendees after they completed the 63-day program.</p><p>Despite dozens of similar accounts of <a href=#>manipulation</a>, <a href=#>starvation</a>, and even torture, the camp went on, garnering more and more participants.</p><p>Even the nation's wealthiest families were sending their misbehaving teens to the camp, hoping it would change their ways.</p><p>The camp's customers included the <a href=#>Winthrop Rockefeller</a> family, who placed their daughter and son in the program.</p><p>In 1990, however, one camp participant managed to change everything – and shut down the camp for good.</p><p>Sharon Fuqua had sent her teenage daughter, Kristen Chase, to take part in the Challenger Foundation's wilderness camp.</p><p>Just a few days into her stay, Kristen went on a hike on Utah's Kaiparowits Plateau.</p><p>She reportedly began complaining that she had a <a href=#>headache</a>, before stumbling and collapsing to the ground.</p><p>The staff reportedly tried to revive her, but Chase fell into a hallucinatory state, and fell down again.</p><p>According to authorities, it took over two hours for medical help to arrive.</p><p>By then, it was too late: Chase, just 16 years old, had died.</p><p>The autopsy report ruled her death as "exertional heat stroke."</p><p>At the time, Fuqua didn't blame Cartisano or the Challenger Foundation for her daughter's death.</p><p>In a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 3, 1990 interview with Deseret News</a>, Fuqua said: “We’re not condemning Challenger. I’ve never met any more dedicated, loving people striving to help children,” she said.</p><p>“What we did for our daughter was the best thing we could have ever done," she added.</p><p>"We felt this was the answer. I truly feel it would have been if she’d been able to complete it.”</p><p>Still, Cartisano and the Challenger Foundation were charged with <a href=#>negligent homicide</a> and nine misdemeanor counts of <a href=#>child abuse</a>.</p><p>As <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by AP News</a>, during the trial, Cartisano said: ″It was a terrible tragedy but nothing could have been done," referring to Chase's death.</p><p>Prosecutor Jim Scarth alleged that Cartisano had previously told his camp counselors that if they encountered any problems with the teens, to "take them behind a rock and thump on them," adding that it was the counselors' words "against" the campers'.</p><p>In 1992, Cartisano was acquitted of all <a href=#>criminal charges</a> in Chase's death.</p><p>However, the national publicity from the case resulted in dozens more <a href=#>civil suits</a> filed against Cartisano and his company.</p><p>According to High Country News, former campers turned out in droves, alleging "negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and breach of contract."</p><p>All cases were settled out of court.</p><p>In Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare, many of the former campers share a surprisingly similar sentiment about their time at the camp.</p><p>While they acknowledge that what Cartisano, the camp's counselors, and the camp did were wrong, traumatizing, and often times illegal, they also refuse to blame them entirely.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>As one former camper put it, "the hardest thing about being there, [was] knowing my parents did it to me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdpboN5fY9qZqGdnKF6pK3MqWStnZWjeq%2B1xqGrppmimnqktMClo56ml5q%2FbrLOrqWdmaSevK951aKaraGdqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nichelle-nichols-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Nichelle Nichols Net Worth 2024: Latest Updates and Financial Journey</span></a>
