I only got me two of the covers that we’d all want to be on. DANG,” she wrote. “And I’m selling sex. Dang again. Oh well. [My mom] Lois loves them.”</p><p>Denise previously shared seven of her old magazine covers in May 2020 after <a href=#>Kyle referred to her as a ragamuffin</a>. “Going down memory lane with this #ragamuffin,” she captioned her Instagram post. “Just a few covers to share for #tbt.”</p><p>The&nbsp;Halloween Kills&nbsp;star caused a stir when she <a href=#>dissed Denise</a> after the&nbsp;Wild Things&nbsp;actress defended her in a fight with the other Housewives. “This one, who’s never worn anything but a f–king mop top ponytail her whole life,” Kyle whispered before calling her a ragamuffin.</p><p>Kyle later changed her tune, though, leaving a heartfelt comment on Denise’s Instagram post featuring her former covers. “Denise, you are absolutely beautiful. There is no doubt about that,” she replied. “I was exhausted, emotional & felt everyone was coming at me. I got upset because I thought you of all people would get what I was saying because you yourself say you don’t get the glam thing and just wear a messy top knot. So I didn’t get the sudden change.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “With that said, I still regret that comment and was not the best version of myself that night. My apologies.”</p><p>Scroll down to take a look at all of Denise’s major magazine covers through the years, from&nbsp;Cosmopolitan&nbsp;to&nbsp;Redbook&nbsp;— with <a href=#>ex-husband</a> <a href=#><strong>Charlie Sheen</strong></a>! — and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWua15w56loquVYr%2Bqr8eaqZ2rXaKuqK3ZoqWeZZOkw6a%2B0maYpqGUYr%2Bpu8GhZJ2qkaKubrzHqKuoq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./goth-egg-biography-all-about-the-social-media-star.html><span>←</span><span>All About The Social Media Star</span></a>
