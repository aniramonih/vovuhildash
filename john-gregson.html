He had a successful film and television career. He played Commander Gideon of Gideon C.I.D. (1964) on television. He died from a heart attack aged 55 in January 1975, just one day before <a href=#>John Slater</a> (Sergeant Stone of Z Cars (1962)). He left a widow and six children.</p><p>His most fondly remembered role was that of vintage car enthusiast Alan McKim, in the idiosyncratic (and typically British) comedy Genevieve (1953). Ironically, while he is featured in almost every scene behind the wheel, Gregson couldn't drive a car when filming began - and proved to be a slow learner. For the remainder of the decade,he became somewhat typecast in traditional 'stiff upper lip' military roles. As film opportunities began to diminish, he turned more and more towards television, enjoying his greatest popularity as titular star of the police drama series Gideon C. I. D.</p><p>During the same period, he was also cast in his first movie, the romantic period melodrama Saraband (1948), though his scenes ended up being cut. Undeterred, Gregson established himself as a popular favorite in subsequent Ealing comedies and later as a long term contractee with the Rank Organisation. His screen personae tended to be men of integrity: regular guys who don't necessarily finish on top, introspective, somewhat diffident, and often troubled.</p><p>A former telephone engineer who dabbled in amateur dramatics, John Gregson served aboard a minesweeper with the Royal Navy during World War II. After demobilisation, he joined the Liverpool Old Vic, making his stage debut in 'The Knight of the Burning Pestle'. Freshly married, he moved to London and acted alongside <a href=#>Robert Donat</a> and <a href=#>Margaret Leighton</a> in 'A Sleeping Clergyman' at the West End Criterion Theatre in 1947.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfn7ypuoygqZ6fo6S7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenny-ryan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jenny Ryan Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
