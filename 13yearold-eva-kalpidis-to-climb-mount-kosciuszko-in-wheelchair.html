It’s the kind of thing a parent never expects.”</p><p>The diagnosis and damage caused to Eva’s tiny body was devastating — but when she watched her younger brother take his first steps aged 18 months, she became determined to do the same.</p><p>“Her brother stood up and started to walk at one, and Eva watched him toddling around and stealing her toys, and from that moment I could see the determination in her little face,” Stacey said.</p><p>“She’s always been focused. She’s got guts and she’s got grit — that showed from a very early age.”</p><p><i><b>To support Eva and donate to help her raise vital funds for Cerebral Palsy Alliance visit <a class=body-link href=# title=www.krazykosciklimb.com.au>her page</a></b></i></p><p>Later this month, Eva will traverse Mount Kosciuszko in a wheelchair as an ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Alliance. She will undertake the climb alongside her mum and aunties under the name Team Sunshine.</p><p>The team will embark on the hike just days after Eva’s first day of high school, and a few months after a corrective surgery to Eva’s hip last year.</p><p>“She’s been in a wheelchair ever since that latest surgery, but that didn’t stop her from wanting to climb,” Stacey said.</p><p>“If anything, we’ve only had to slow her down and remind her that recovery takes time.”</p><p>Team Sunshine has already raised more than $80,000 that will go towards a state-of-the-art gym facility to help with therapy for those living with cerebral palsy — and donations are still open.</p><p>Eva herself has undergone “every type of therapy imaginable” to assist in her goal, including hydrotherapy at six weeks old, physiotherapy twice every week, speech therapy and a school readiness program that her mum says was instrumental in allowing her to “live day-to-day life”.</p><p>Still, Stacey said she never doubted her daughter, describing her as “like a bull at a gate”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“I always knew she would walk,” she said.<br></p><p>“She was never going to take no for an answer.”</p><p><i>To sponsor Eva’s climb visit </i><a class=body-link href=#><i>www.krazykosciklimb.com.au/fundraisers/teameva</i></a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8eemKWsmGR%2BdMXEmqmopJRisretjKSYpaiZmba0edOoZJykmaKvbrnOrqWtZZukwKS11KyxpKddnrtuw8eenKWbmJa2s3vNnq6sZaOpvLPFjnBtaW%2BWmn91fpJynHCelmV9p4LBmm9ubpZqsXWAwGlt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-still-stay-in-elisa-lams-room-at-the-cecil-hotel.html><span>←</span><span>Can You Still Stay In Elisa Lam's Room At The Cecil Hotel?</span></a>
