He's a talented fashion designer with a namesake label, has dressed everyone from Lady Gaga to Michelle Obama, and even serves as a judge on Project Runway. But somewhere on his vision board was another, perhaps slightly unexpected, goal he'd always hoped to achieve: working with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Walmart</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had written down a bucket list for myself and being able to speak to someone at Walmart was on that list," he tells InStyle over the phone. "It's somewhere I shopped growing up, and it was always a dream of mine to be able to take what I've learned and give that back to communities like mine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year ago, he succeeded in making that dream come true, signing on as creative director for two of the company's elevated fashion brands, Free Assembly and Scoop. Now, just in time for Spring 2022, his first collections since taking on the role have arrived and are ready to shop in-store and online.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Brandon Maxwell.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My biggest job is really bringing unity and cohesion across all categories," he explains, adding that he works closely with Denise Incandela, who oversees Walmart's apparel brands as its executive vice president. "When I'm sitting down with the teams at the beginning of the collection, we may talk about a word, or a theme, or a general feeling that we want the customer to have in their experience with the clothing. Then, while design teams are sourcing the fabrics and sketching, I'm thinking about 'OK, how will all of this live together, ultimately? The story that we tell, the videos that we create, the images that we create — how can we carry that through to the finish line?' It's a multilayered job, and I enjoy all parts of it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like most of fashion design, Maxwell says this job is a true "team sport" and one of the biggest perks has been expanding his knowledge, discovering more about each brand's aesthetic and how he can add to it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Anything that I'm looking to do in my life is about learning and about growth, so the challenge of it was really exciting for me," he says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to Free Assembly — a brand that caters to men, women, and children and focuses on mixing, matching, and layering — Spring 2022's offerings revolve around <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>themes of joy</a> and optimism.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You'll see a lot what I describe as essential colors, patterns like stripe play or gingham, eyelet, these really comfy-cozy spring fleeces, colorblocking, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>printed denim</a>," he tells us. "There are things in there that, I feel, you will want to wear years from now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Should you be perusing the Free Assembly racks, Maxwell recommends hitting up the jeans section, which will allow you to shop premium denim at a more affordable price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The denim and the knits are some of my favorites," he shares, noting that he wears the pieces himself. "I could go on and on, but there are these printed overalls for women, and a little short overall for girls that has these beautiful little printed flowers on it that I'm just obsessed with."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Free Assembly.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prints, he says, are also a big factor for Scoop, which is described as more trend-focused and offers pieces that will enhance your wardrobe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm sure if you look at my brand, you know that I love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leopard</a> as well, which I think is a neutral," he tell us when talking about what to shop for Spring 2022. "There's a leopard print in there that is bright orange and pink, that I just fell in love with when we were coloring up prints."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maxwell says Scoop's denim is a must-try, too. This time around, the collection includes everything from jumpsuits to dresses, which are alongside another seasonal essential, knit colorblocked dresses — a trend the designer says he's a huge fan of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I came in, and I remember the first week someone said to me, 'Wow, you really love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>colorblocking</a>.' I do. I don't think there's any color that can't go together, why not? Dressing for me has always been a way to say to the world who you are. It's about making those bold choices. I hope that we've accomplished that in the design, and made something that everyone can feel good in."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Scoop.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for what's to come in the future, Maxwell says it's all about expanding the brands and possibly bringing more accessories to the mix. "The total look is always really important," he explains — which is good news, since the extra-large bags from his Brandon Maxwell Fall 2022 collection happened to be a huge hit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The big bags were really exciting for me this season," he tells us about his latest collection, for which his grandparents were the source of inspiration. "When we got the first bag, I'm like, 'It needs to be five times bigger — it needs to be as big as their love. It needs to be really big.'"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Brandon Maxwell Fall 2022.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can shop both <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Free Assembly</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Scoop</a>'s spring collections now at Walmart and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">walmart.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2Svs63NnaanZZ2Wxbixy6VksJmcoq6zwIysp6uhnpx6c3yRaw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anneliese-judge-phone-number.html><span>←</span><span>Anneliese Judge Phone Number, WhatsApp Number Contact Mobile</span></a>
