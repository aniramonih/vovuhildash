The subject of “Teardrops On My Guitar” is accused of drunkenly hitting a 3 year old in the face.</p><p>Emergency responders were called to Hardwick’s home in Hendersonville, Tennessee to treat injuries to the child. The Tennessean reported that the victim suffered lacerations and severe bruising on her face as well as a concussion. When police arrived, Christopher Hardwick immediately blamed Andrew, claiming he saw Swift’s former flame hit the little girl. Officers noted what looked to be blood on Andrew’s hand.</p><p>A 5-year old witnessed the alleged abuse and told officers that Andrew hit the little girl. Amber Hardwick confirmed that Andrew Hardwick was the only adult around the young victim when she was injured. The injuries to the 3-year-old girl were so severe that she had to be airlifted to the hospital. The whole situation sounds really scary and chaotic.</p><p>Christopher also told officers that he and Andrew had been drinking all day. Coincidentally, Christopher was also arrested for attempting to assault an officer. Andrew’s wife, Joni Hardwick, was arrested after attacking an officer and won herself a bonus charge for resisting arrest. Naturally, she wasn’t just going to calm down simply because the officer told her to stop. Joni has already been released from the Sumner County Jail along with Andrew, whose bond was set at $100k.</p><p>Talk about dodging a bullet, Andrew was the subject of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Taylor Swift</a>’s 2006 hit “Teardrops On My Guitar.” Drew is named in Taylor’s song, something the singer rarely does. As a matter of fact, Swift is often coy about who may have inspired her songs and fans are left to speculate about which breakup or boyfriend the song is about. It really sounds like this accused child abuser might be the love of Taylor’s life or the one that got away. Andrew Hardwick is, after all, one of the first men that Swift wrote a song about that turned into a hit.</p><p>Andrew tried to hook back up after <a rel=nofollow href=#>Taylor</a> got famous but the singer wasn’t having it. In an interview with the Washington Post, Swift admitted that after the song came out, Hardwick showed up at her house. It sounds like the whole situation was pretty awkward and Hardwick clearly missed his chance. Taylor has to be just horrified after news of her childhood crushes’ scandalous arrest.</p><p>Image credit to FameFlynet</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG5npJbGrbvRZqqwoZapwG6v0a6qoWWRo7GzsdZmn5qqlKy2pLeMnJ%2BipJRirqPB0p5knKCRp7SmedKumaOdk6l6tbHAq5urp6CoerC6jKawZp%2BlnsGivo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./talanoa-hufanga-biography-age-parents-salary-girlfriend-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Talanoa Hufanga Biography , Age, Parents, Salary, Girlfriend Instagram</span></a>
