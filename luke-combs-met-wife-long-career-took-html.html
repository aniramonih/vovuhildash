With tunes such as “Beautiful Crazy” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” he has drawn comparisons to icons like Tim McGraw and Eric Church, but Combs boasts a style all his own. He’s been working hard for years to achieve the impressive accolades and <a href=#>net worth</a> he has earned, so he wasn’t an overnight success. And Luke Combs’ wife, Nicole Hocking, has been by his side through it all.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-did-luke-combs-meet-his-wife>When did Luke Combs meet his wife?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Luke-Combs-wife-Nicole-Hocking.jpg><p id=par-2_58>Luke Combs was born in 1990 and raised in Asheville, North Carolina. From an early age, he was drawn to music, performing as a vocalist as a child. Combs sang with numerous vocal groups during high school and dropped out to pursue a country music career. He moved to Nashville, where he buckled down, writing and publishing songs.</p><p id=par-3_45>It was a long climb to the top for Combs. The artist released multiple EPs in 2014 and debuted his first popular single, “Hurricane,” in 2016. Around that time, as Combs struggled to find his footing in the hard-to-crack industry, he met Nicole Hocking.</p><p id=par-4_36>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brides</a>, the two first crossed paths at the Key West Songwriters Festival in 2016. Combs later recounted that they locked eyes from across the crowd, prompting Combs to invite Hocking to dinner in Nashville.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-luke-combs-and-his-wife-nicole-hocking-tied-the-knot-in-2020>Luke Combs and his wife Nicole Hocking tied the knot in 2020</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_57>Combs and Hocking hit it off quickly, and by late 2016, the two were exclusively dating. Hocking became Combs’ muse, inspiring his 2017 hit “Beautiful Crazy,” based on their romance. As Combs became more popular in the country music biz, Hocking continued to support him, stepping out to industry events with him and praising his hard work.</p><p id=par-6_48>In 2018, Combs’ career took off with the release of “She Got the Best of Me.” Only one year later, the Grand Ole Opry invited him to become a member, and the same year, his album What You See Is What You Get became a runaway hit.</p><p id=par-7_45>Even though Combs was a star by this point, he didn’t feel the need to play the field, solidifying his relationship with Hocking by popping the question in November 2018. And in August 2020, the two tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Florida.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-next-for-the-country-music-star>What’s next for the country music star?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_31>Since their wedding, Combs has written <a href=#>more music for his wife</a>, including the song “Forever After All,” paying tribute to the positive influence that Hocking has had in his life.</p><p id=par-9_31>And in January 2022, they announced they were expecting their first child. Since then, Combs has been open about how excited they are to start the newest chapter of their lives.</p><p id=par-10_45>In a recent interview with People, <a href=#>Combs opened up</a> about impending fatherhood. “I got a lot of stuff to do. I got a lot on my plate,” he revealed. “I’m uncovering things every day. I’m buying all kinds of clothes I didn’t know existed.”</p><p id=par-11_31>The singer joked he’s learning plenty about baby accessories. “I didn’t know what a bassinet was. But that’s a thing apparently,” he admitted. “A lot of new words I’m learning.”</p><p id=par-12_11>Clearly, <a href=#>Combs and Hocking</a> are still successfully navigating the spotlight together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5trfEZpqopZKoeq6x02auop6VYrmwusZmmpqqlZq%2FbsDOqKJnoKSiuXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luann-de-lesseps-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Luann De Lesseps Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
