Now Underwood and Fisher are a happily-married pair.</p><p id=par-3_59>Like any celebrity couple, fans tend to have a lot of questions about Underwood and Fisher’s relationship. For example, the topic of money is quite popular. Since Underwood seems to be more well-known than Fisher, some onlookers might be wondering: Does she make more money than he does? And what is their combined net worth? Here’s what we know.</p><h2>How did Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mike-Fisher-and-Carrie-Underwood.jpg><p id=par-4_41>Underwood and Fisher first met in 2008 via her bassist, Mark Childers. Childers initially wanted to set them up on a blind date, but Underwood was hesitant about meeting Fisher because they lived far away from each other at the time.</p><p id=par-5_27>“I mean, can I make dating more difficult?” Underwood said in the&nbsp;Behind the Music special in 2012.&nbsp;“Let’s get a hockey guy who lives in another country. Awesome.”</p><p id=par-6_32>However, Underwood eventually agreed to meet Fisher at one of her meet-and-greets. Things ended up going well at the meeting because Underwood immediately texted Childers that Fisher was “hot, hot, hot.”</p><p id=par-7_27>Meanwhile, Fisher later shared that Underwood “was more beautiful in person than on TV.” Underwood and Fisher went on their first date a few months afterward.</p><p id=par-8_44>Then, they simply had a long-distance relationship that involved a lot of talking on the phone. By the end of 2009, the couple had gotten engaged. They tied the knot in the summer of 2010 in Georgia in a big wedding with 250 guests.</p><p id=par-9_26>Fortunately for Underwood and Fisher, in 2011, he ended up joining the Nashville Predators, which allowed them both to settle down together in the same place.</p><h2>How many children do Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher have?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-10_14>Underwood and Fisher currently have two sons: Isaiah (b. 2015) and Jacob (b. 2019).</p><p id=par-11_41>While they seem like the picture-perfect family, Underwood has been open about the fact that they struggled a lot to get to where they are now. After Isaiah was born, Underwood suffered from three miscarriages in less than two years.</p><p id=par-12_44>It took a toll on her in many different ways. She told <a href=#>People</a>: “Of course you wonder if it’s you, what am I doing wrong, or what have I done wrong. I remember having conversations with Mike trying to make sense of it all.”</p><p id=par-13_33>Underwood tried to stay positive and learned to accept that she might not have another child. However, she and Fisher were overjoyed when they learned that she was pregnant with Jacob in 2018.</p><p id=par-14_15>Now, the couple is focusing on their careers while being parents to two young boys.</p><h2>Does Carrie Underwood have a higher net worth than Mike Fisher?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-15_40>For the past 15 years, Underwood has been one of the most popular country singers around. Her net worth definitely reflects how far she has come in her career. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Underwood is worth around <a href=#>$65 million</a>.</p><p id=par-16_24>Fisher’s career hasn’t been too bad either. He played professional hockey for almost 20 years and amassed a net worth of around $30 million.</p><p id=par-17_46>Clearly, Fisher is worth less than Underwood, but the two of them seem to be living a very comfortable life together. They used to live in a beautiful house in Brentwood, Tennessee, but they put it up for sale a year ago for $1.45 million.</p><p id=par-18_23>Now they live in Franklin, Tennessee, in a house that they built on a plot of land that they purchase back in 2010.</p><p id=par-19_35>Despite being multimillionaires, Underwood and Fisher do not live ultra-extravagant lifestyles. They live in comfortable houses and go on <a href=#>vacations</a> to tropical beaches and Disneyland, but ultimately, they are still very down-to-earth by Hollywood standards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLHSZpqaqqKesm7BzZ2cq6%2BfpLFutMCvnGaZXZ22qLTEq2SnnaRixLC%2B06FkraCRo3qpsdFmn66rkpa7pXnMoqKeZZaewKmx0WefraWcZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-you-believe-is-cm-punk-a-lying-cheater-121220.html><span>←</span><span>Do You Believe: Is CM Punk a Lying Cheater?</span></a>
