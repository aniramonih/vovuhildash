For 13 seasons, he was an enormous part of the Miami Heat franchise, bringing three titles to the city. Miami fans thought he'd be a Heat lifer, retiring in South Beach and having his banner hung from the rafters.</p><p>That's why the city, and really, the entire basketball landscape, was shocked when Wade left Miami to return to his hometown Chicago Bulls, to the tune of two years and $47 million. He turned down a deal from the Heat that was worth $40 million over two years.</p><p>So that's it? Wade turned his back on a lifetime of support and loyalty with Miami, all for a measly $7 million? Oh, if only it was that simple. Wade has actually been the one making most of the sacrifices, giving up about $17 million during his career with the Heat.</p><p>In fact, during 13 seasons in Miami, Wade was never the highest-paid player on the roster.</p><p>Along with <a href=# title="LeBron James Net Worth">LeBron James</a>, <a href=# title="Carmelo Anthony Net Worth">Carmelo Anthony</a> and <a href=# title="Chris Bosh Net Worth">Chris Bosh</a>, Wade was selected in the 2003 NBA Draft. However, those three players have consistently signed max-level contracts, and by extension, have made more than Wade in the NBA. Through this past season, Wade has made $152.9 million. That's $10.3 million less than Bosh (who's made $163.2 million in his career), $16.7 million less than James ($169.6 million), and $23.6 million less than Anthony ($176.6 million).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200172 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-146084627.jpg alt="Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200172 class=wp-caption-text>Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images</p><p>Average all those numbers together, and Wade could have made about $170 million, had he only been looking out for himself, a difference of about $17 million. The gap is widening, too: Assuming LeBron James signs a one-year deal again and then inks a four-year contract for the max once the salary cap jumps again, Wade will not only be about $39 million behind Bosh when their current contracts expire, he'll be a staggering $150 million in the hole, compared to LeBron.</p><p>Wade has always taken less money in order to help the team win. He gave up a max contract to get LeBron and Bosh to come to South Beach, and it resulted in two championships. When LeBron left in 2014, Wade again took a pay cut so the team could sign <a href=# title="Luol Deng Net Worth">Luol Deng</a>.</p><p>Ironically, Wade's latest contract may have been the one that led to his divorce from <a href=# title="Pat Riley Net Worth">Pat Riley</a> and the Heat. He said he would welcome a three-year, $60 million deal, which is the same annually as what he just turned down. Instead, he ended up signing a two-year contract with an option to opt out after the first year.</p><p>Wade opted out, once again to give the Heat the financial flexibility to go after <a href=# title="Kevin Durant Net Worth">Kevin Durant</a>. But when the team prioritized <a href=# title="Hassan Whiteside Net Worth">Hassan Whiteside</a> over the guy who had been there for 13 years, Wade felt slighted. The franchise would have made the financial room for Durant, but not for Wade.</p><p>Really, the Heat knew the writing was on the wall. They had their ceiling, and when Wade didn't want to take it, they bid each other farewell. It's a shrewd move on Miami's part, but they didn't want to be crippled by a bulky contract, especially when Wade has missed, on average, a quarter of a season the past four years. They'll likely put all their eggs in the <a href=# title="Russell Westbrook Net Worth">Russell Westbrook</a> basket as they try to find a new face of the franchise.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, Wade returns home to Chicago. It's a long shot, but maybe he'll follow in LeBron's footsteps and bring a title back to the city he grew up in.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjrCYrGWUrMaiusRmrpqclWLAprjFoqqhZaSkerXB0adknaeno3p1fIymoKWkmaS7brLRqKRmrJiaeqmxwK1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./missing-mike-hanley.html><span>←</span><span>Update | Missing Mike Hanley Found Safe: Know Everything About this Incident</span></a>
