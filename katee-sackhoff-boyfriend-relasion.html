No, guys, he is not related to famous singer <strong>Keith Urban</strong> by any means. The couple is very comfortable with each other and is also familiar with each other's family.</p><h2>Karl Urban's second attempt to find love</h2><p>After a failed marriage, Karl Urban is all set to find love again. Prior to Katee, he tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Natalie Wihongi</strong></a> in September 2004. The couple seemed very happy in their marital relationship but a decade later, they announced their separation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/10/natalie-1-1568091336287.jpg><p>The reason for their divorce is not shared.
