Though it’s been more than a decade since the Joaquin Phoenix and Reese-led film gave people an in-depth look at the life of singer <a href=#>Johnny Cash</a> and his wife, June, many fans of the movie are still wondering —&nbsp;did Reese actually lend her voice to the soundtrack? The short answer is yes!</p><p><a href=#>MUST SEE: See All the Books Reese Witherspoon Has Recommended to Her Fans!</a></p><p>“I had to do four months of rehearsals,” she has shared. “I had to learn to play autoharp. I had to take singing lessons. I had to record an album, which was the most challenging, horrifying experience of my life.” Because of the vocal element of Walk the Line, Reese has since deemed the film one of the “hardest” projects of her life. “It’s been so hard, it’s been really, really one of the hardest movies I’ve ever had to make,” she confessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/reese-witherspoon-singing-in-walk-the-line-2005.jpg><p>Reese as June in Walk the Line.

Country music is just a part of my heritage and my upbringing,” <a href=#>the 41-year-old said</a>. “It’s in my blood… and I’m always looking for characters that portray a real or realistic struggle of a woman.” And portray a real woman’s struggle, she did. June and Johnny fell in love while still in marriages to other people. Later in their relationship, she also cared for Johnny and dealt with the brunt of his drug addiction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46doJ1lopqytLGMsKCtoJWnwLG7zqdkrKGenHq4rcukZK2glWK5qrrEZmhtaGBqgnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cybill-shepherd-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Cybill Shepherd Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
