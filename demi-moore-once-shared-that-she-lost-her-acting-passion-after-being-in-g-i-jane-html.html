Jane</a>. The movie featured Moore as Jordan O’ Neil, who was recruited into a new U.S. Navy program that allowed women into their services.</p><p id=par-3_41>Despite Moore’s passion for the project, the movie didn’t do too well at the box office. It earned $48 million during the entirety of its run and was received unfavorably by critics. But it wasn’t a reaction that Moore agreed with.</p><p id=par-4_46>“It was really underrated, at a moment when they [critics] just didn’t want to let me win,” Moore once told C Magazine (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact Music</a>). “But, to this day, it is still one of my favorite films that I have had the privilege to be in.”</p><p id=par-5_18>She also shared the backlash towards the film was what caused her to take a break from Hollywood.</p><p id=par-6_26>“It was that kind of crushing that really sent me into a space that lost a little bit of passion and maybe disheartened me,” she added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-demi-moore-went-through-real-navy-seal-training-for-g-i-jane>Demi Moore went through real Navy Seal training for ‘G.I. Jane’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_30>Moore did a lot to prepare for G.I. Jane. To add authenticity and credibility to the film and her character, <a href=#>the Ghost star</a> did real intense training for the film.</p><p id=par-8_30>“It was hardcore,” she once told <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> about the training. “Obviously, ours was modified, but we had all real scenes down there, and it was me and 40 guys.”</p><p id=par-9_19>At one point, after puking and getting blisters on her feet, a consultant told Moore the training was unnecessary.</p><p id=par-10_39>“Harry Humphries, our consultant, he said, ‘You know, you don’t really have to do all this.’ And I thought, ‘If I don’t right now I’ll never get it back.’ Of, y’know, the respect. I’m playing an officer,” she reasoned.</p><p id=par-11_30>Moore also remarked that she wasn’t treated any differently than other Navy Seals in the program. When she was late one time, Moore was yelled at just like everyone else.</p><p id=par-12_54>“He was screaming at me, ‘Who the f*** do you think you are. You think we’re gonna let some split-tail come in here, drop your f***** ass down,’” Moore once recalled when she was told to do push-ups. “I was like, ‘Ok.” And then I go in and then he screams at everybody else.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-demi-moore-felt-her-film-striptease-affected-g-i-jane-reception>Demi Moore felt her film ‘Striptease’ affected ‘G.I. Jane’ reception</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_46>Moore believed her role in Striptease played a part in the critical reaction for G.I. Jane. For Striptease, she earned a salary that was record-breaking for female actors at the time. Moore believed the amount she earned on Striptease might have created some resentment towards her.</p><p id=par-14_49>“I think G.I. Jane got hit because I was paid <a href=#>$12 million to do Striptease</a>,” Moore told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W magazine</a>. “In a sense, Striptease was a film where women felt I betrayed them. G.I. Jane is a film where men felt I betrayed them. The focus went on that paycheck.”</p><p id=par-15_33>In an interview with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>, Moore felt the salary she was paid helped the careers of other female actors, too. But she conceded that the difference it made was minimal.</p><p id=par-16_39>“I know that it really resonated,” she said. “It’s not about me doing it. I was just the instrument by which it was done. Clearly, it didn’t do enough because we’re still, this many years later, dealing with it.”</p><p id=par-17_13>Still, Moore was honored to be that kind of trailblazer for her peers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxprnIZqSop6KaerC6wp5krKCRp7KledOhmK1lo52ybrjOrKtmoJWneqKv06KloGWglsC0tc6nZJqepJq%2Fbq7EoqWgZZmjeqh5yGahmqaVY7W1ucto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-bakhtiari.html><span>←</span><span>David Bakhtiari is currently Dating his Girlfriend, Frankie Shebby since 2017</span></a>
