I thought I was the only one who gave a crap. But it’s sad, isn’t it? They were together for a looooong time, and they have three beautiful girls. Unfortunately, my initial theory was right, or it seems like it so far, in the immediate wake of the split announcement. Scallywag & Vagabond is reporting that Peter had and still has (?) a side-piece. Booooo.</p><p>As we first broke the story last night right here on Scallywag & Vagabond, Peter Facinelli & Jennie Garth have called it quits. Now we’re getting details from our source saying a third party was one of the “many reasons” behind their split.</p><p>Our source tells us, “Peter had been seeing another woman for quite some time. They tried to make it work for the sake of their children and Jennie played housewife for as long as she could but finally had enough.”</p><p>On the affair, they say, “Jennie knew. As a lot of couples do, they simply grew apart. As the mother of his children, Peter still loves Jennie very much and vice versa.”</p><p>So just who is this other woman? Our source tells us a she is a Canadian woman in her late 20′s. “Understandably, she does not want to be identified by the media.” She and Facinelli began what’s being called as a “short, torrid affair” in Vancouver during the filming of the final installment of the Twilight saga, Breaking Dawn. When asked if the two were still together or in contact? “No comment,” says the source.</p><p>In a joint statement, the couple say, “While we have decided to end our marriage, we both share the same deep love and devotion to our children. We remain dedicated to raising our beautiful daughters together. We ask for privacy and respect during this time.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Scallywag & Vagabond</a>]</p><p>The verdict: Twilight ruins everything!!! This never would have happened if Facinelli hadn’t been in Canada (damn homewrecking Canadians!!) filming the Twilight movies. Seriously, though, I am still disappointed. Even though I said yesterday “He seems like the kind of guy who might have a side-piece,” I really did hope that I was wrong. Poor Jennie.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wenn5387320.jpg alt title=wenn5387320 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wenn5507419.jpg alt title=wenn5507419 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wenn5808609.jpg alt title=wenn5808609 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma2lkboR6e8%2Beq56qj5uupLXNnqOloY%2BsrrSr0Z6nqKqkmrGtxb6cn56ZpJ67qKvOp5ajnZ6jtqarxpqpraCPrLa1tL6alpyZnpaxqq3NmKqinJVivaqxwp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./twins-division-title-celebration.html><span>←</span><span>Twins live it up after clinching AL Central title, with Kenta Maeda leading the way</span></a>
