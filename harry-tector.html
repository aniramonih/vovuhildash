The campaign was disastrous for Ireland as the team lost all 3 of their group matches and was relegated to the ‘Plate League’ where they eventually finished a disappointing 13th overall out of 16 teams. The squad was being captained by his older brother, Jack.</li><li>Harry captained the Irish squad at the subsequent edition (2018) of the tournament.&nbsp; However, the team’s fortunes barely improved as they finished in 13th place yet again. The only silver lining for him was that he was the leading wicket-taker (8 wickets) for Ireland in the tournament.</li><li>In November 2018, he was named the ‘Male Academy Player of the Year’ at the annual Cricket Ireland Awards.</li><li>In July 2019, he had been selected to represent the Dublin Chiefs in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam (a professional T20 cricket league that aimed to involve 6 city-based franchise teams – 2 each from Ireland, Scotland, and the Netherlands). However, about a month later, the tournament was canceled.</li><li>In January 2020, he was one of the 19 male players who were awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland (officially known as the Irish Cricket Union, the national governing body for cricket on the island of Ireland (both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) that oversees the national men’s and women’s cricket teams). This was the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full-time basis to Irish professional cricketers.</li><li>In March 2021, ahead of the 2021 season, Harry was named the new captain of Northern Knights (a domestic team in the Irish cricket circuit). He had been involved with the team since 2018. However, at the end of the 2021 season, he parted ways with Northern Knights and joined Leinster Lightning, the most successful team in the Irish domestic circuit.</li><li>In July 2022, in the first match of Ireland’s home bilateral series against New Zealand, Harry recorded his first century in ODI cricket. His stellar knock of 113 runs helped Ireland set up a challenging target of 301 runs for the Kiwis. It all ended in heartbreak though, as New Zealand, tottering at 217/8 at one stage of the chase, somehow managed to overhaul the steep target. Ireland’s misery was conveyed by the fact that the target was achieved with just 1 ball and 1 wicket to spare.</li><p>Featured Image by Harry Tector / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqGYq6qpYsGmr9OoqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halima-rashid-jackson-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Halima Rashid Jackson Net Worth (2024 Update)</span></a>
