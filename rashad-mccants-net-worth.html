His professional career began in 2005.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Rashad McCants is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Rashad`s net worth is currently as high as $4 million, earned through his basketball career. Apart from playing in the NBA, he has spent several years in different leagues, playing for such teams as Pirates de Quebradillas, Powerade Tigers, Forshan Long Lions, Uberlandia, Trotamundos de Carabodo and Caneros de La Romana, among others, which also improved his wealth.</p><h3>Rashad McCants Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Rashad first played competitive basketball in Clyde A. Erwing High School, in his hometown, but he was transferred to New Hampton School in New Hampshire. While there, he led his team to the 2002 New England Prep School Class A championship, and received the MVP award after the final game. Rashad also received several honors, including being named as Parade All-American and McDonald`s All-American Teams.</p><p>After matriculation, he enrolled at the University of North Carolina, where he continued with his basketball career, and in his rookie season was the best scorer in his team, averaging 17.5 points per game which earned him a spot on the All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) rookie team. The following season, his numbers became even better, posting 20 points per game, which earned him selection into the Second Team All-American. In 2005, he and newcomer <a href=#>Marvin Williams</a> led the team to the NCAA ring, defeating the Illinois Fighting Illini 75-70. After he won the NCAA championship, Rashad declared for the 2005 NBA Draft, and ended up being selected as the 14th overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves, marking the beginning of his professional career and the basis of his net worth.</p><p>In his first professional season, Rashad played in 79 games, 12 of which were starts and he averaged 7.9 points for the 17 minutes he spent on the floor. The next season was disastrous, as he played only in 37 games without making the starting team, and averaged only 5.0 points per game; he was constantly injured, and just couldn`t show his full potential. In the 2007-2008 season, Rashad showed some of his arsenal and averaged just a bit under 15 points in the 75 games he played, and also had 2.7 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game. However, after another discouraging season, with only 9.1 point in average, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings, where he played in 24 games and averaged 10.3 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.5 assists, but after his contract expired, the Kings decided not to renew, and he became free agent. After that, he was in training sessions with several clubs, including the Houston Rockets, Cleveland Cavaliers and Dallas Mavericks, but none of the teams chose to sign Rashad.</p><p>Instead, he was sent to the Texas Legends, which is an affiliate of the Dallas Mavericks, but his stint there didn`t last long. In 2012 he joined Powerade Tigers of the Philippine Basketball Association, but the same year he was released. His next stop was France and the basketball club Strasbourg IG, but before even he put on the club jersey he signed a contract with the Foshan Long Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). Unfortunately he didn`t stay there for long either, and since then has changed between several teams as previously mentioned, but without any major success.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Rashad dated <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> in 2008, but other than that, little is known about his personal life.</p><p>He has had problems with his alma-mater, accusing the university that teachers had done his classwork and helped him a great deal to acquire his diploma, but as of present, there is no closure about the case.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4.02416918429><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rashad McCants</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 25, 1984</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Asheville, North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.93 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>94 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, New Hampton School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Rashanda McCants</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5064313/</a></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Basketball Wives: Temper Tantrums w/ Ev</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Short</td><td>Baller</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Reach Around Radio</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself / Himself - Timberwolves Center</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjquYrKCRmXqur8Kapa2rXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quinn-lily-wolfeld-gosk.html><span>←</span><span>Quinn Lily Wolfeld-Gosk is the Celebrity kid of Lesbian couple Stephanie GoskandJenna Wolf</span></a>
