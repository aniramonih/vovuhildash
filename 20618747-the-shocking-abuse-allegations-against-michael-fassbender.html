The next morning Andrews found Fassbender “sleeping in urine” and when she tried to wake him up, he allegedly threw her over a chair and broke her nose.”</p><p>That’s interesting.

But it doesn't quite make sense that she had all that documentation and only got a simple temporary restraining order. Fassbender should really have been arrested for that if it happened.
