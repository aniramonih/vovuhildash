<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Who Is Caesar Mack From 90 Day: The Single Life?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Caesar Mack</strong>, a North Carolina native, will feature in season 3 of 90 Day: The Single Life, which premieres on TLC on Monday, September 12 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. Caesar made headlines again last year after appearing in season 3 of 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days. He claimed to be “good friends” with Drake, who messaged him straight after viewing the reality program. Caesar said during one of the episodes of 90 Day Bares All:</p><p>“He messaged me and said, ‘Hey Ceas, how are you?'” We had only recently become friends when he sent me some of his clothing from his clothing line. Yes, he’s a wonderful guy.”</p><p>His disclosure astonished presenter Shaun Robinson, who inquired about their blossoming relationship, to which Caeser replied:</p><p>“Every now and then, we’ll phone each other to check how we’re doing. He’ll phone and say, ‘Hey Ceas, how are you, what’s up, how you been?'”</p><p>Caesar will now appear in 90 Day: The Single Life in order to find love once again.</p><h2>Caesar Mack’s previous relationship did not go as planned</h2><p>Caesar Mack made an appearance in season 3 of 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days when his connection with a Ukrainian woman named Maria wowed audiences. Not only was he deeply in love with her, but he also used to send her money every month without ever seeing her in person. They used to converse only via their phones. The former pair dated for five years, during which time he sent her $800 every month. Caeser and Maria never met since Maria canceled their meeting in Mexico at the last minute.</p><p>He also claimed that he unwittingly paid for her trip, which she intended to spend with his fellow 90-Day Fiance celebrity, Jesse Meester. Caesar stated:</p><p>“You know, when she traveled to Barcelona, I paid for that vacation.” She said that she needed money to pay her expenses. And, despite the fact that they claimed to be friends, you have no idea what they did when she was in Barcelona with him. They could have done something different. We’ll never find out.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Caesar-Mack-1.jpg alt="Caesar Mack" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He fell in love with Aya, a Louisiana native, after terminating his romance with Maria. The pair met on Facebook and started dating there.&nbsp;Caeser, however, is now single and seeking a long-term relationship, which he expects to discover on 90 Day: The Single Life. According to his official show bio:</p><p>“90 Day fans’ favorite nail tech, Caesar, returns to the series in search of true love—and this time, he’s not stopping until he meets Mrs. Right.” Caesar is seeking for a lady who is interested in his heart, not his wealth, following a disastrous 5-year internet romance.”</p><p>It goes on to say:</p><p>“With his 50th birthday approaching, Caesar realizes that time is running out to meet the lady of his dreams.” Caesar is determined to make his next affair last by enlisting the assistance of a professional matchmaker in Kyiv.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Caesar-Mack-2.jpg alt="Caesar Mack" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Will Caesar find his true love on the reality show?
