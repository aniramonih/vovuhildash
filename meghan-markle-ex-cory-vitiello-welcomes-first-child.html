The star chef and his partner, Dragonette singer <strong>Martina Sorbara</strong>, welcomed a baby boy last week, and the proud dad couldn't wait to share the news on his private Instagram account, as first reported by <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p id=eREr4vHh8tgI data-wc=72>"It wasn’t easy but we got you out of hiding," he revealed in the caption. The Toronto-based owner of Flock Rotisserie + Greens also took a moment to gush about his partner, saying, "Welcome to earth, little man — your mama is a super hero, FYI." Before she hooked up with Prince Harry, Cory and Meghan dated for two years from 2014 to 2016 following her <a class=hm-link href=#>divorce from Trevor Engelson in 2013</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4bcc3d12853b-body35-z.jpg><p id=eGg9LPnZPk7E data-wc=64>Of her new relationship, her ex had nothing but nice things to say when he spoke to the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a> a month before her <a class=hm-link href=#>royal wedding</a>, saying he was "pleased" for her. "She's a great girl," Cory said. "There is no bitterness. I respect people's private and personal lives, and although she has put herself in the public spectrum, I still hold to that."</p><p id=e3eejpasqRAV data-wc=86>Back in 2014, the alum took to her then-new blog, <span></span>, to toast a neighbourhood restaurant that had stolen her heart - and taste buds! The chef at cast favourite Harbord Room was Cory, and she couldn't help but sing his praises. "And maybe that's part of it – the small-town charm and moral compass of someone who doesn't come from the big city, but dreams big thoughts and makes them happen – that makes his food so approachable yet inspired," she gushed.</p><p id=e7HZMnA2s3ko data-wc=73>Meghan is surely thrilled for her ex as they both live their happily ever afters, he as a new father and she as the newest member of the Royal Family. The newly minted <span><strong>Duchess of Sussex said "I do" to Prince Harry</strong></span> at St George's Chapel on May 19 following an almost-six-month engagement. The spectacular event was broadcast to the world and celebrated by millions.</p><p id=eAMLQVNsouMH data-wc=62>Since her stunning nuptials, Meghan has been steadily <a class=hm-link href=#>checking off royal firsts</a> like Trooping the Colour, solo engagements and an outing with the Queen. She will mark another debut off her list this month as she and Prince Harry embark on their <span><strong>first official royal tour</strong></span> of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and the Kingdom of Tonga on Oct. 16.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
