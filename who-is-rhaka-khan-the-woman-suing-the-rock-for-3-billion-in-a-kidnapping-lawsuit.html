She also began modeling before starting her career in wrestling in 2005. She first appeared in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE</a> Diva Search under her real first name Trenesha.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Although she was eliminated in the top 25, she would later sign a contract with the WWE and be assigned to Deep South Wrestling. Afterward, she signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2008 where she would take the stage name of Rhaka Khan. Biggers continued wrestling under that name for a little over a year at TNA before leaving.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-rhaka-khan-outside-of-wrestling data-injectable=false>What happened to Rhaka Khan outside of wrestling?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rhaka-Khan.jpg><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>Whilst Biggers has never been too forthcoming with what’s going on in her personal life, she did enter a relationship with WWE champion and professional wrestler Kurt Angle. Both were signed on to TNA between 2008 and 2009 and they had an on-screen relationship. The relationship ended after <a href=#>Biggers accused Angle of abuse and subsequently obtained an order for protection from abuse in August </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2009,</a> although later withdrew the order voluntarily. Angle is one of the names to appear in her lawsuit.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>In 2019, Biggers was placed on El Paso’s most wanted list on the charges of interfering with child custody; she allegedly took her child away from the father without consent. After skipping numerous court dates, she was eventually arrested in October 2021.</p><h2 id=h-what-rhaka-khan-s-lawsuit-details data-injectable=false>What Rhaka Khan’s lawsuit details</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-12.png><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>The suit filed under her name tells another story. Biggers alleges that Angle aided and abetted her ex, Ephraim Sims. She claims that both conspired with law enforcement to make false accusations regarding her in order to take her children away from her.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Biggers’ suit asks for $3 billion in damages and lists a shocking 23 pages with over 400 defendants. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwayne Johnson is among the many celebrities whose name appears in the document</a>, which also includes Eminem, Michael Jordan, the actual FBI, and many others. The former wrestler intends to legally represent herself in the case.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>While many are confused as to how Dwayne Johnson fits into all of this, it seems that the list of defendants has been targeted without too much reasoning. Biggers does not explain how Johnson fits into the suit, other than the fact that he may have known both the plaintiff and defendant through WWE.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>The case was dismissed in June of 2023 by the United States District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain. In the order dismissing the suit, it states that “The Court must dismiss an IFP complaint or portion thereof, that is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.”</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>Khan has not publicly commented since the case’s dismissal but hopefully, things will look up for her soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmqpiWuKJ5yqGYp2WknbJuw86mmKdlo6q2r7OMrZ%2BeZaKksKx5xaipZmtdl7atuMiopWahnmKubrfInaWaqKCeu6h5y5qurK2ZqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lovely-mimi-ex-husband-remy-skinner-details-we-know-about-the-couple-and-their-separation.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Lovely Mimi Ex Husband Remy Skinner?
