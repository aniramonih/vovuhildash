<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>'Florida Man' Episode 1: Mike's mysterious pursuit in Florida starts with a SHOCKING twist</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Spoilers for 'Florida Man' Episode 1</strong></p><p><a title="Edgar Ramirez" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edgar Ramirez</a> has made a comeback on the small screen with Netflix’s crime-drama ‘<a title="Florida Man" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida Man</a>’ which tells the story of an ex-cop named Mike Valentine. He has been given a task to return to his home state of Florida and find the girlfriend of a Philly mobster Moss Yankov. The premiere episode of the Netflix series has laid a strong foundation and things can only get better from here. The first episode is all about Valentine’s pursuit and things got really intense as he reached Florida.</p><p>The episode began with Moss giving Valentine the task of finding his girlfriend, Delly West (Abbey Lee), who ran away in her new BMW. Valentine accepts the job, but there’s a catch. Valentine says that he would take $50,000 to do this job and that amount will be cut from what he (Valentine) owes to him (Yankov). He takes a flight to Florida and steals a gun for his pursuit. He spent his childhood in Florida and as soon as he reaches there, he gets a lot of good flashbacks about the time he had spent here with his family. It’s not easy to find her and she is not leaving any stone unturned to stay hidden. Even though he has some photos of West roaming the state, it’s not easy for him to catch her. He meets his father, Sonny Valentine (<a title="Anthony LaPaglia" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony LaPaglia</a>), and asks about Delly. He says he doesn't really know about her, but the way he says it feels like he is hiding something. Mike leaves empty-handed.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a title="Is the Netflix series 'Florida Man' based on a true story?" href=# rel>Is the Netflix series 'Florida Man' based on a true story?</a></p><p><a title="Top 5 Edgar Ramirez movies to watch before 'Florida Man' hits Netflix" href=# rel>Top 5 Edgar Ramirez movies to watch before 'Florida Man' hits Netflix</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a84c71ba-f5d5-4475-a243-ff091fbe24f8.jpg><p>However, he finally gets a lead when he gets to know where the BMW is. The BMW has been sold to a car dealer and as soon as Mike reaches the dealer, he checks the car and finds a parking ticket. He takes the parking ticket and finds the location which turns out to be a bar. After a lot of searching, he finally sees West entering the bar and after some time, she comes out with a man and they both sit in West’s car. Valentine follows them and reaches West’s place. However, things get really weird when Valentine hears a gunshot coming from West’s room.</p><p>Valentine enters her room and finds out that she has been killed and because the owner has already called 911, he runs away from that place.</p><p>The next day, the police arrive and talk to the owner who says that she saw the person who might have killed her. A sketch is drawn and it turns out that she saw Mike. The police officer meets Mike’s dad who is an influential person in Florida and was the Police chief as well. Although the police officer is trying to warn him that he might not be able to help his son, Mike’s dad is not worried about his son because he knows that he will take care of the situation.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Mike changes his identity and tracks down a local news reporter to get some inside information. He charms her with his personality and gets the raw video of the ambulance that was taking Delly to the hospital. To his shock, Delly was not in the ambulance and things get really intense for him because he thought taking Delly back to Philly would be easy, but it’s not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/45300988-d8f7-49be-90d9-70a90f7b767d.jpg><p>The episode ends with a shocking twist when Mike finds out that the door of his room is unlocked and someone has entered his room. The last frame of the episode sees Delly lying on Mike’s bed and saying, “I got to the mini bar.” Mike is shocked and a little happy to see Delly back.</p><p>But why did Delly fake her own death? Did Delly know that Moss sent Mike to get back to Philly? Or Mike’s dad has to do something with this? This ride is only going to get more and more thrilling as Mike tries to save himself from the authorities while trying to solve this mystery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonpykv6qwwGakmqZdmr2qv86dnGZpXaK2rLHSZqSyq6Sav6q71Kxkqa2iqMKqwIyipWaenKS%2FqrDAZqqtmaKpwG7DyK2fZpldqLWwr8qipaBlpKy2tMA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./welcome-response-to-thanks-perhaps-html.html><span>←</span><span>___ welcome (response to thanks perhaps)</span></a>
