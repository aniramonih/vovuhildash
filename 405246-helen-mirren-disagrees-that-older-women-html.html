She revealed, "I hate that word. Kate Moss is beautiful, so is David Beckham, and I can appreciate a beautiful girl walking down the street. Young is beautiful. But the majority of us are something else, and I wish there was another word for it."</p><p class=dh>When confronted with compliments suggesting that she has only become more attractive with age, Mirren <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/26/helen-mirren-interview-sally-hughes ">approaches</a> them with skepticism.
