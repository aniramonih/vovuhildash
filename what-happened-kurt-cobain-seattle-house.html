As <a href=#>Seattle PI</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;whose journalists went to the house as news of Cobain's death broke, recalled in a 2013 feature — though the Cobain house was inaccessible to the public, a nearby bench came to serve as a makeshift memorial site for admirers of Cobain who came to see the place where he spent his final days.</p><p dir=ltr>Though <a href=#>Courtney Love</a> remained at the house, she did make one symbolic alteration to the property related to Cobain's death. The Nirvana frontman had died in the property's greenhouse,&nbsp;rather than the house itself, and at some point after his death, Love had the greenhouse torn down. She lived there until 1997, when she sold the house that Cobain had initially bought for $1,485,000, per <a href=#>King County</a> records.&nbsp;Despite the house's tragic history — or perhaps because of it — the value of the house roughly doubled in the space of three years, to $2,895,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2xscWpgZMSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMpKyrrF2YvKOtyKdkrJ2RqcGtsYyhpq6rlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-at-joel-osteens-lakewood-church-and-were-there-any-survivors.html><span>←</span><span>What happened at Joel Osteens Lakewood Church, and were there any survivors?</span></a>
