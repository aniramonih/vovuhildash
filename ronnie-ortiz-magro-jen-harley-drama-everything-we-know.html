Shortly after they got together, Ortiz-Magro left their home in Las Vegas to shoot Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. As the show later revealed, the reality star’s behavior during filming made his roommates question whether he was staying faithful to Harley.</p><p>After one of the cheating-themed episodes aired in April 2018, the couple started exchanging insults via social media and seemingly got into a physical altercation on Instagram Live. They broke up and tried to focus on coparenting Ariana amicably.</p><p>The truce didn’t last, though, and by May 2018 they were publicly feuding again after Ortiz-Magro appeared to cheat in another Family Vacation episode. They got back together briefly, then split again before the month was out. “It’s going to keep changing every day,” a source told Us Weekly at the time.</p><p>In June 2018, the on-off couple were <a href=#>involved in a public altercation</a> while filming Family Vacation. Police determined that “a battery did not take place,” but two weeks later, Harley was <a href=#>arrested for yet another altercation</a> with Ortiz-Magro. The Clark County District Attorney eventually decided not to press charges against Harley, saying there was “insufficient evidence.”</p><p>The pair seemingly got back on track for the rest of the summer, but in October 2018, the MTV personality shared a photo of himself with a black eye and implied that his then-girlfriend was to blame. They exchanged more digs via social media but reunited in time to do a couple’s costume for Halloween.</p><p>Their pattern of <a href=#>on-again, off-again dating</a> continued through most of 2019 until things hit a breaking point that October, when <a href=#>Ortiz-Magro was arrested</a> and charged with seven misdemeanors, including domestic violence. He pleaded not guilty to all charges the following month.</p><p>The exes kept things civil throughout 2020 and each moved on with new partners, but in April 2021, the New York native was <a href=#>arrested for a second time</a> while in Los Angeles. Harley was not involved, though a source told Us that Ortiz-Magro had Ariana in his care at the time of his arrest.</p><p><strong>How big are reality star salaries? Jason Tartick breaks it down with Us Weekly editors.<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p>After news of his arrest broke, Harley <a href=#>drove from Las Vegas to L.A.</a> to retrieve Ariana and claimed that it was the “last time” she planned to make that drive. The former couple did not address the situation any further.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a complete history of Ortiz-Magro and Harley’s dramatic relationship.</p><p>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the <a href=#>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv7C6zaKcZqeiqba7ecyanqunXZ%2Byr3nHmqmlnalisbOtzJpknq6Vp8a1tMinnmavlWK4r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rebecca-herbst-19770512-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rebecca Herbst (Soap Opera Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
