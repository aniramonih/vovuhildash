From the get-go, Ariana made it clear that she did not want to get married or have kids while Tom, on the other hand, wants both.</p><p>The ‘Vanderpump Rules’ star has been very vocal about her disdain for marriage and disgust with giving birth. Although the SUR bartender seems very adamant about her decision, the TomTom owner has always been hopeful that he could change her mind.</p><p>On last night’s episode of the Bravo show, Jax Taylor, Tom Schwartz, and Tom Sandoval went out to eat for Sandoval’s birthday. The topic of starting a family came up in the conversation where Jax revealed that he wants to have children with Brittany Cartwright as soon as they’re married and Schwartz wants to conceive with Katie Maloney in the near future.</p><p>Jax asked Sandoval if he thinks that he and Ariana will have children. Tom said that his girlfriend does not want to give birth but maybe she can agree to adopt.</p><p>When questioned about how he would feel if Ariana would shut that down completely, Sandoval responded: “When it comes to kids, I feel like I definitely want to have one or two at some point in time and to not have that option, is a deal breaker for me.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Ariana has a similar talk with Brittany where the newly engaged SURver tells Madix that she wants three children.</p><p>When Cartwright asks if she would entertain the idea of having a baby (whether it be naturally or adoption), Madix retorts: “Before I would even be comfortable considering the idea of having kids, I would need to check off all the places I want to go in the world, which is kind of all of them, and I would also just like… I don’t know, want to.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Ariana has been very transparent on views about her future with Tom. Hopefully, they can have that important conversation and come to an agreement before it manifests into a bigger problem down the road.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGemlrulsdGprKaoXafCrbHSZqqtmaJiwbC5jKyYp5yfq66tedKasKxlkae2orrAZqSanJmteq%2B702aumqaknruoecqim6xlmah6onnDnpilZZKnsqK3xKtka2xgZoZxew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tulisa-contostavlos-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tulisa Contostavlos Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
