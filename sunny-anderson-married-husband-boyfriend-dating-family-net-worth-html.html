She hosts multiple shows on the channel, cooking classic dishes and sharing secrets of her unique recipes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here's what you should&nbsp;know about the celebrity chef.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Her Hardships at an Early Age</h2><p>Being a woman of color, Anderson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">experienced</a>&nbsp;racism from an early age. She used to be treated inhumanely by white kids in her neighborhood, who hurled nasty words and bullied her.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to her educated mother and army father, growing up with her brother in such circumstances was a little easier. Her mother taught her self-esteem and unhesitantly&nbsp;clapped back at haters who dis-served them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Slowly and steadily, Anderson became like her strong-willed mother, forging a career in full-throttle.</p><p>She didn't hesitate to join&nbsp;U.S. Air Force as a radio broadcaster, although the career wasn't close to her culinary passion. She started her service in 1993 with stride and worked in Seoul, South Korea, and San Antonio, Texas.&nbsp;</p><p>"I knew that there were radio stations, television stations, newspapers, and magazines, for the military, by the military, and I wanted to be a part of that." she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told</a>&nbsp;ABC News in 2013.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Moving to different places helped&nbsp;Anderson learn about various cuisines and polish her culinary skills.</p><p>However, she thought&nbsp;of turning her passion into a career only after joining New York's Hot 97 radio station in 2001. She had got the job after her tenure in the military.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anderson's Culinary Career</h2><p>As a child, Anderson played&nbsp;with cooking instruments instead of&nbsp;toys. And when she grew up — even if embroiled in journalistic activities — she shared her skills with her friends, cooking them lunches and dinners.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Impressed by her skills, her friends encouraged her to forge a career in <a href=# rel=follow>culinary arts</a>. Serendipitously, Food Network noticed her skills in talking and cooking and approached her for a show.&nbsp;</p><p>Anderson debuted in the Food Network as a special guest in the Emeril Live&nbsp;show in 2005. Following that, she hosted Gotta Get It&nbsp;in 2007.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her hosting gig in the&nbsp;How'd That Get On My Plate?, starting from&nbsp;July 2008, catapulted her to success. She soon became the chef host of&nbsp;The Kitchen&nbsp;alongside Jeff Mauro, <a href=# rel=follow>Katie Lee</a>, among others.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2021, she started hosting Easter Basket Challenge and My Fave vs. Your Fave.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>How Much Is Her Net Worth?</h2><p>Anderson has hosted over twenty programs in Food Network, which undoubtedly has enriched her burgeoning net worth. She still shares her skills in shows like Cooking For Real, Home Made In America, and The Kitchen.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As per Celebrity Net Worth, the Loyola graduate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has</a>&nbsp;a fortune worth&nbsp;$5 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A part of her net worth should be credited to her best-selling cookbook 'Sunny's Kitchen: Easy Food for Real Life' published on September 17, 2013.&nbsp;To top it off, she also has merchandise that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sells</a>&nbsp;customized T-shirts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anderson's Relationship Status</h2><p>If her social media is anything to go by, Anderson's is neither married&nbsp;nor dating. She has also shared nothing of her relationship status in her interviews and shows, which hints at her singlehood.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, the 46-year-old was vocal about her past relationship some years ago, albeit not revealing her partner's identity.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an interview with Delish in 2009, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;she had a boyfriend who was just as foodie as her.&nbsp;Anderson also shared that she prepared&nbsp;three square meals a day for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Then in 2016, she tweeted, saying she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had</a>&nbsp;only two serious ex-boyfriends till that time. The Kitchen host&nbsp;also stated that both of them had met her parents.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>no, not at all...my parents know I'm enjoying the single and dating life with no goals. They've only met 2 serious boyfriends — SunnyAnderson (@SunnyAnderson) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">December 29, 2016</a></p><p>A year after that,&nbsp;Anderson apparently went through a heartbreak.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In January 2017, she took to Twitter to announce she was dating a man named Columbo. Just months later, she updated her fans that she was on a date with her book. When a follower commented that a look at the book would make her sad,&nbsp;Anderson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quipped</a>&nbsp;it was better to be alone than with a liar and a cheater.&nbsp;</p><p>The turbulent updates on her social media hints that her relationships didn't sail smoothly.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlno6q7r8WMmqWdnaKovK95zJqpq6GVmXqpwdKbmKecXZe8urLRopynnF2ZrrW1zaBkn5mdnrm6ec2eq2avn6fBqXrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./onguito-wa-man-or-woman.html><span>←</span><span>Is Onguito Wa Man Or Woman?
