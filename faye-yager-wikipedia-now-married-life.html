FX is making a documentary about her titled&nbsp;Children of the Underground, which will air on 12 August 2022.</span></p><p><span>It's hard to find information about her as Faye Yager's Wikipedia is yet to be created.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Faye Yager Wikipedia Details And Parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>Faye Yager is the founder of Children of the Underground. Based on a documentary named Children of the Underground advocated for non-custodial parents to kidnap their children in order to save them and help families disappear and start new identities. No one has ever created Faye Yager's Wikipedia.</span></p><p><span>Faye Yager, currently 74 years old as of 2022, was born to her parents in 1948. She was born to a West Virginia coal miner's father. As she is living her life as low as possible, there is no information about her father or mother. She had the birth name Billie Faye Wisen. Faye has a total of 10 siblings, and she was born as the fourth among 11 children to her parents.</span></p><p><span>As she was born in West Virginia, she holds an American nationality. Moreover, she has white ethnicity and has faith in Christianity as her religion. Since she was married early, she never got a chance to graduate from any high school. At the Age of 74, she has a height of 5 feet and 5 inches.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Faye Yager's Married Life</span></strong></h2><p><span>Faye Yager got married to a man named Roger Jones in 1975 when she was just 17 years old. The then-couple had a daughter, Michelle. Her husband was an abusive guy and even molested their daughter when she was just five years old. Eventually, they separated, but Jones was given custody of the daughter even though he was unable to explain why their daughter had contracted gonorrhea. Jones didn't stop molesting Michelle. However, he ended up in jail with 30 years sentence for molesting three children.</span></p><p><span>Eventually moving with her life, Faye Yager married a physician Howard Yager from Atlanta. After marrying her current husband, the couple had four children who are currently in their adulthood.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Faye Yager's Children Of The Underground</span></strong></h2><p><span>At the end of the 80s, Faye Yager had an underground network where she had hidden more than a thousand abused children from a legal system that too often delivered them to their abusers. Doing this, she had been engaged in multiple legal issues.</span></p><p><span>Top among them was the case of Bipin Shah, an entrepreneur. According to Bipin, Faye assisted his&nbsp;ex-wife, Ellen, in fleeing the country with their daughters. Eventually, Erin and her kids returned to the USA, and the charges were dropped. In the 1990s, she had lots of other legal issues. In 1992, she was&nbsp;accused of kidnapping and emotional cruelty to the children she was supposed to help.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where Is Faye Yager Now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Currently, Faye Yager lives a life out of any spotlight. However, reports show that she runs 16 room inn in North Carolina. Moreover, there is no information about her still running an underground network. In 2016, she admitted that she still supported families and kids with the aid of her organization.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunDA0Z6lnaGenHynrdieZLKZl5q%2FbsPIpKCpnZSerm66zrBkppmip7amsIyloJ%2Bd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-wu.html><span>←</span><span>Eric Wu - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</span></a>
