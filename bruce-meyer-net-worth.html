Bruce Meyer is based on Los Angeles and was destined to be involved with cars in some way from a young age. His mother wrote in his baby book, "Bruce loves anything with wheels". He grew up racing dirt bikes and participating in drag races. After finishing college, he decided to shift his passion from racing cars to collecting them. He has gone on to amass one of the most celebrated car collections in the world, and owns dozens of rare and vintage vehicles from around the globe. His collection has won numerous awards, including eight at the Pebble Beach Concours d' Elégance. Mattel released a "Hot Wheels" series featuring some of the cars from his collection and named it after him. He has also served as the Chairman of Los Angeles' Petersen Automobile Museum, which has a gallery devoted solely to his cars.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356067 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bruce.jpg alt width=900 height=612 sizes="(max-width: 1758px) 100vw, 1758px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356067 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Eric Charbonneau/Getty Images for Neon)</p><h2 id=car-collection><strong>Car Collection</strong></h2><p>collection is noted for its focus on both rarity and historical significance, encompassing a wide range of vehicles from classic hot rods to vintage race cars and iconic luxury automobiles.
