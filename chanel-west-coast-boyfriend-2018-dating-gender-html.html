The last thing I need is a f******&nbsp;OnlyFans link in my bio," after she was&nbsp;asked about her OnlyFans dilemma.</p><p>"But I think that doesn’t even matter these days because it seems like these types of girls are getting married before me,"&nbsp;Coast added.</p><p>Those statements clarify that the rapper is seeking a perfect soulmate apart from fans and fame. And if she already had one, she would not be making such statements. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition to that, her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> account, where is updates her daily life, lacks the presence of any man, too.</p><p>All that being said,&nbsp;Coast previously <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated</a>&nbsp;musician Liam Horne from 2014 to 2017. The former couple also collaborated on the album titled 'Waves' in August 2015.</p><p>However, their relationship didn't last long, as they separated just before Coast joined the TV show Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Chanel West Coast and her ex-boyfriend Liam Horne on a red carpet of MTV Movie Awards at Warner Bros back in 2016 in Burbank, California. </strong>(Picture:&nbsp;zimbio.com)</p><p>Besides&nbsp;Horne,&nbsp;the 'America’s Sweetheart'&nbsp;musician had a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">boyfriend</a> named&nbsp;Saul, who was&nbsp;shot and killed on December 7, 2007.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My ex boyfriend Saul was shot and killed on December 7, 2007. Today he would have been only 24 years old. RIP Saul. I'll always luv u! î€¢ — Chanel (@chanelwestcoast) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 12, 2010</a></p><p>Coast has also&nbsp;been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">linked</a> to fellow Love & Hip Hop star Solo Lucci, and&nbsp;entrepreneur and reality TV personality Rob Dyrdek, in the past.</p><h2>Gender Conspiracy: Chanel West Coast Is Not a Boy&nbsp;</h2><p>The side-by-side picture of <a href=# rel=follow>Chanel West Coast</a> and actor Lee Norris, who played Minkus on the sitcom&nbsp;Boy Meets World, was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">viral</a> on the internet with the captions suggesting they're the same person.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>A picture posted on Twitter comparing Chanel with Minkus and mentioning them as the same person. </strong>(Picture: intouchweekly.com)</p><p>Whether in the form of a meme or headlining a story related to the transgender community, it's nearly impossible to ignore such topics. That picture sparked rumors that Coast was a guy before her Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood and MTV days.</p><p>But later, she cleared out all the rumors in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with In Touch, where she mentioned that she was going through a legal situation to try and get all of that offline because it's technically defamation of character if one labels her as transgender. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Coast also took to her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> on June 22, 2016, to deny all the rumors question her gender.</p><p>She wrote, "I got news for all these dumb sites posting that ad saying I'm transgender and used to be minkus...you got a BIG lawsuit coming your way lol."</p><h2>Her Short Bio</h2><p>Coast was born on September 1, 1988, in Los Angeles, California, USA. Her birth name is Chelsea Chanel Dudley. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She initially went to Taft High School. However, after studying for two years, she dropped out and instead took the homeschooling&nbsp;route to&nbsp;complete&nbsp;her high school studies.</p><p>Growing up, she spent her time living between North Hollywood with her mother and New York City with her father. Her father was a hip-hop DJ and used to take her to nightclubs throughout the city as a child while her mother was a salesperson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGianqSVl8Bwr8eapZ6kXayytMCMnKaaq6Rir7DFxaugnqaUYn9xfZdmm5qsmaO0brPEp5ueql6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./campbell-wilson.html><span>←</span><span>Campbell Wilson Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More StarsUnfolded</span></a>
