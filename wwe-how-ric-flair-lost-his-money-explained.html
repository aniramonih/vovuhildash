The 16-time world champion was the face of the National Wrestling Alliance, and while he wasn’t as big of a draw as Hulk Hogan at the time, the Nature Boy was still regarded as a star attraction. His gimmick was gold and his in-ring work was stellar. As the face of the NWA, Flair made quite a lot of money. His star power remained intact throughout the 90s, and he had no trouble finding employment with WWE and WCW. Ric Flair was one of the highest paid wrestlers on the WCW roster and Vince McMahon gave him a decent contract upon his return to WWE in 2001.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=update-2024-02-14-13-30-est-by-andrew-kelly>UPDATE: 2024/02/14 13:30 EST BY ANDREW KELLY</h3><p>Ric Flair is one of the most legendary professional wrestlers of all time - but one thing he is one of the worst at is handling his money.

According to some sources, his entire net worth, in 2022, is about $500,000. This guy was making multi-millions in the 1990s, so what happened?

The Nature Boy once spent $40,000 on a robe that struck his fancy, and this is not counting the copious amounts of expensive jewelry he bought over the years. Beyond that, Flair was not too savvy when it came to financial planning.</p><h2 id=ric-flair-got-in-trouble-with-the-irs>Ric Flair Got In Trouble With The IRS</h2><h3 id=flair-feuded-with-the-irs-amp-not-mike-rotunda>Flair Feuded With THe IRS (& Not Mike Rotunda)</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Ric Flair avoided paying tax during his prime</strong></li><li><strong>Ric Flair has been followed by the IRS throughout the last few decades</strong></li><li><strong>Flair invested his money in the incorrect places, causing issues</strong></li></ul><p>Throughout the 1980s, Flair did not pay taxes, making the IRS his rival for the rest of his life. The IRS came knocking on his door in the 1990s, and while Flair was able to pay the owed amount, this set the tone for the rest of his life. In 2005, the IRS seized his earnings to pay back the taxes he owed. As recently as 2019, Flair was served a notice to pay $280,000 and the troubles continue to this day. Flair was also prone to <a href=#>investing in the wrong places</a>. The Ric Flair Finance program was struck down almost immediately as it was illegal. Flair had invested quite a lot of his money into the project, albeit he was pushed into the project by a shady guy named Chris Porter. Porter then sued Flair for a loan he was owed and that brings up factor number three; Flair took a lot of loans and barely paid them back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/10-unpopular-opinions-about-ric-flair-according-to-reddit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>10 Unpopular Opinions About Ric Flair (According To Reddit)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Let’s take a look at a few unpopular opinions about Ric Flair that have shown up on Reddit.</span><p><a href=#>The Nature Boy had to borrow a substantial amount of money from McMahon</a> to pay the taxes he owed to the IRS, and while McMahon forgave the loaned amount, the other folks didn’t. He was sued so often on the basis of a default that Flair’s own lawyers sent him letters for professional fees. With all the people looking to get their money back, and the IRS knocking on his door every month, Ric Flair burned through the wealth in his coffers and soon after his WWE exit in 2008, he was almost bankrupt and living on his monthly paycheck.</p><h2 id=richard-fliehr-could-not-afford-living-like-ric-flair>Richard Fliehr Could Not Afford Living Like Ric Flair</h2><h3 id=the-man-behind-the-gimmick-couldn-39-t-live-up-to-his-own-expectations>The Man Behind The Gimmick Couldn't Live Up To His Own Expectations</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Ric Flair spent a lot of money through his life</strong></li><li><strong>Finances were spent through his various divorces</strong></li><li><strong>Flair needed to rely on others to support his lavish lifestyle</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ric Flair also went through five divorces, but even with all these financial troubles going on in his life, Richard Morgan Fliehr was still living his life as the Nature Boy, spending $14,000 on Christmas gifts and $200,000 on jewelry in 2009.

The deal fell through but Bochicchio remained friends with Flair, and he would lend him money from time to time. Early on, Flair only asked for a couple thousand dollars, but as time went on, he requested more and more. Flair put forward his NWA belt as collateral, and when Highspots went to sell the belt, they found out that the same belt served as collateral to a different company. And Ric Flair owed said company an even bigger amount of cash. Bochicchio said (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">H/T Cageside Seats</a>) that Flair had absolutely no plans for the future. In the end, Richard Morgan Fliehr could never separate himself from Ric Flair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ric-flair-was-helped-out-by-vince-mcmahon>Ric Flair Was Helped Out By Vince McMahon</h2><h3 id=billionaire-vince-mcmahon-got-ric-flair-out-of-trouble>Billionaire Vince McMahon Got Ric Flair Out Of Trouble</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Vince McMahon himself has shelled out a lot of money throughout his life</strong></li><li><strong>McMahon got Ric Flair out of some tough spots</strong></li><li><strong>McMahon has a close bond to those who have been loyal to him</strong></li></ul><p>As previously noted, Ric Flair ended up both spending and borrowing a lot of money, and he revealed a lot of this information himself, being very open about his financial troubles.

Not everything was doom and gloom for Flair, noting in that interview with Austin that;</p><p>"I've been rich, I've been poor, I've owed the IRS $1 million once, $2 million once.

Flair would also recently come out of retirement for a second time, and it is hard to argue with the notion that it was in fact money-oriented yet again, especially since he revealed on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">To Be The Man podcast</a> that he made $300,000 from the match. He has been someone who has always needed extra cash, even in the last couple years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJutM6wZKuhk2Kzra3Iq2Slp6Opeqm10makqKaVrnqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristin-minter.html><span>←</span><span>Home Alone Actress Kristin Minter's Married Life!
