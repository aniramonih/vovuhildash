She sat alongside <a href=#><strong>Meredith Vieira</strong></a>, <strong>Star Jones</strong>, <a href=#>Barbara Walters</a> and <strong>Debbie Matenopoulos</strong> during the first season of the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Is-Joy-Behar-Leaving-‘The-View-TV-Career-Details.jpg><h2><b>Did Joy Behar Get Fired From ‘The View’?</b></h2><p><span>Over the years, the hosting panel on the program has gone through a number of changes, with many beloved hosts stepping down from their positions. Longtime viewers were shocked when Joy temporarily left </span><i><span>The View</span></i><span> in 2013. The </span><i><span>Baby Boom </span></i><span>actress was relieved when she was initially ousted from the series.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“When they told me they weren’t renewing, I said, ‘Good, I’m out of here,’” she told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in March 2017. “I didn’t like the way the show was going at that time.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After making several appearances as a guest cohost in the months that followed, Joy returned to </span><i><span>The View</span></i><span> as a full-time cohost in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in,” she said in a statement at the time. “And I’m looking forward to sticking my two cents into the hot topics.”</span></p><p><span>Years after Joy left the show and made her return, the comedian reflected on the whole situation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I was glad to be fired,” she admitted during a July 2022 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>Time</span></i></a><span>. “I basically was sick of the show at that point for some reason, I don’t even remember why.”&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Is Joy Behar Still on ‘The View’?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Though she has taken time off from the show here and there, Joy is still a main cast member on </span><i><span>The View</span></i><span>. In fact, the TV personality is the <a href=#>longest-serving host</a> on the series.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Is Joy Behar Leaving ‘The View’?</b></h2><p><span>It doesn’t look like Joy has any plans to leave the long-running television phenomenon any time soon.</span></p><p><span>“I just signed a contract, so I’ll be here for a while,” she told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in October 2022. “I have no plans to retire.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, Joy, who is married to </span><a href=#><b>Steve Janowitz</b></a><span>, was approaching her 80th birthday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s really, you know, something that is an important show in many ways,” the New York native continued. “Sometimes I don’t believe that, as I’ve been here since the beginning, but we’re the most-watched show in daytime.
