In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Streets of Toronto</a>, Sarah and Bryan Baeumler talked about how they began dating. According to Sarah, she and Bryan first met in high school, and while they didn't date, they kept in touch afterward. "In 2001, we were both copied on an email from a mutual friend, which was the catalyst for us to begin talking again, and we decided to reunite over coffee after work," Sarah explained. Sometimes chain messages aren't THAT bad, right?</p><p>The duo ended up having an official first date in September 2021. Bryan was the mastermind behind the plans, and the two hit the town in Toronto. "First, we went and saw 'The Lion King' theater production, which was fantastic. Afterward, we went for a lovely sushi dinner," Sarah told Streets of Toronto. "He definitely pulled out all the stops, and it was a very exciting first date." Of course, things progressed, and Bryan popped the question in Nova Scotia. For the wedding, the pair stuck to their roots and wed in Toronto before jetting to Las Vegas for a honeymoon.</p><p>To celebrate a sweet milestone, Bryan has paid tribute to his wife on social media several times, including in 2015.&nbsp;<strong>"</strong>#tbt to 11 years ago when I married this beautiful lady! Happy Anniversary," he wrote via&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;alongside a photo from their wedding day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlibIF6gY6hnKudo2K1sMOMq5ynp6aWwaq7zWagrKSRo7G0ecGrsJqmXZa7pXnSmqmaoF2XrqbBzKWcq2WXpMFuwM6gnK2glad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gigi-hadid-street-style.html><span>←</span><span>Gigi Hadid's best street style moments</span></a>
