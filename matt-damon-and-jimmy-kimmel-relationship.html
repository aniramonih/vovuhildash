We’re talking about Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel’s protracted conflict. The two famous people are known for occasionally feigning “hatred” towards one another, but when did this fake feud start?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Matt-Damon-And-Jimmy-Kimmel-Relationship-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jimmy_Kimmel_and_Matt_Damons_relationship></span><strong>Jimmy Kimmel and Matt Damon’s relationship</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Jimmy Kimmel jokedly apologised to Damon for running out of time as he wrapped up his third season of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in 2005, the whole affair got started. In 2013, “We Had a Bad Show,” Kimmel told NPR. At the conclusion of the programme, I was feeling very horrible about myself and the guests, so I decided to say it for the producer next to me’s pleasure. The host of Kimmel’s show opted to make the joke every single night because the show’s producer liked it.</p><p>So why did Kimmel use Damon as the punchline for his jokes? He said the first name that came to him was the actor from “Air”. “I was trying to think of an A-list star and somebody we absolutely would not bump if he was on the show,” said Kimmel. Since then, the two have been exaggerating their relationship with a variety of insults on talk shows, in interviews, and in a number of hilarious films, including one from 2015 in which they opted to attend ‘couples therapy’. The little joke quickly evolved into its own creature.</p><p>Recently, the two have resumed their mutually amusing antics, with Kimmel poking fun of Damon as he hosted the 2023 Academy Awards. Was it challenging to film your movie “The Martian” because your costar Matt Damon can’t read and smells like dog medicine? the emcee jokingly asked Jessica Chastain in the audience.</p><p>Kimmel and Damon continued their verbal battle on the latter’s “Air” red carpet premiere on March 27, when they both spoke to Entertainment Tonight. When asked if he would ever patch things up with Kimmel, the “Air” actor joked to ET, “No, no, he’s an asshole. Why would I ever do that? He is a terrible human being. It’s evident that he’s a terrible man. “I just can’t imagine,” Kimmel quipped at the time to the website.</p><p>On March 28, Damon’s “Air” co-star Ben Affleck appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and made an effort to mediate a reunion between the two. Along with Damon, the cast also includes Jason Bateman, Viola Davis, Chris Tucker, and Marlon Wayans. “I understand you have your feuds and everything,” Affleck said in response to the presenter leaving out Damon. “But Matt is a friend of mine.” Honest to God, it would mean a lot to me if you just asked him one question about the movie, he said. He may be reached by phone.</p><p>Despite Kimmel’s protests, Damon’s image appears on the large screen behind the host’s studio desk, and the two genuinely have a nice conversation about the movie. However, as Damon answers Kimmel’s question, his screen starts to shake, and soon a carousel of annoying image-distorting filters bother him. The actor then yells at Kimmel to end their talk, “Why don’t you take your little show and shove it up your big hairy ass!”</p><p>Even though we can’t imagine a world without their iconic feud, we can’t help but wonder what may have happened if the host had mentioned another A-list actor back in 2005, such as Kevin Bacon or possibly Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Steve Harvey And Marjorie Relationship</a></li><li><a href=#>Donatella Versace Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Net Worth, Young, Daughter, Fashion</a></li><li><a href=#>Keisha Lance Bottoms Wiki, Wikipedia, Bio, Husband Illness, Resigns, House, Children, Instagram</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtopZGpwW6wwKamp2WRo7FutsimpLJlm566rrHLZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-carlson-obituary-omaha-mark-carlson-has-passed-away.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Carlson Obituary, Omaha, Mark Carlson Has Passed Away</span></a>
