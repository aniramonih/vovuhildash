The Real Truth Explained!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>People started suspecting John Cena to be gay after he was seen wearing heels and a skirt at the shooting location of his upcoming comedy movie Ricky Stanicky. Well, the rumors are fake; he is not gay and is happily married to Shay Shariatzadeh.</strong></p><p>Have you ever received a special gift? Can you imagine that the special gift you received was from your favorite celebrity? The same condition happened to Kowloon Restaurant, which received a gift from a notable<strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>actor</a></strong>, <strong>John Cena</strong>. Can you guess what the gift was?</p><p>This week, John Cena thanked Kowloon restaurant by sending the custom Air Force completing it with a signature and a handwritten letter. After the restaurant received the gift, they thanked him and posted the picture on their Twitter account on April 1. The North Shore restaurant and local artist Sway collaborated to produce the limited edition sneakers to support nonprofits in the local area.</p><p>After the news spread on the Internet, people became more interested in John's personal life. Do you know about his personal life? Is he gay? Who is he currently dating? To know more about his personal life and if he is gay or not, read this article.</p><p>Previously, we revealed the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>orientation</a></strong> of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Patrick Stewart</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jordan Henderson</a></strong>.</p><h2>Is John Cena Gay? He Has Been Married to Shay Shariatzadeh Since 2020!</h2><p><strong>John Cena</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@johncena</a>) is not gay and is happily living his life with his wife, <strong>Shay Shariatzadeh</strong>. He was rumored to be gay after he was seen with a girl at his shooting range. The dress was the demand of his character and nothing else.</p><p><strong>John Felix Anthony Cena</strong>, aka <strong>John Cena</strong>, is an American professional wrestler, actor, and former rapper currently signed to WWE. He started getting involved in sports activities during his high school years when he was a member of the college football team. He began his career in 1998 by moving to California, where he began training for a professional wrestling career.</p><p>Besides being an active wrestler, he is also known for his movies and music. He has never failed to amaze his fans and has always been an inspiration to many people. Talking about his personal life, the first thing everyone knows is that he does not want to have children because he does not want to be an absentee parent. Following the statement, many thought that he might be gay. Is he bisexual?</p><p>John's first public <a href=# rel=noopener>relationship</a> was with <strong>Elizabeth Huberdeau</strong>. There is no more news about Elizabeth, but she is said to be an agent, developer, and businesswoman. The pair got married on July 11, 2009, but the marriage didn't last as long as Cena filed for divorce on May 1, 2012, and ended their relationship. The pair shared many ups and downs from high school to the beginning of their careers but failed to save their marriage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/john-cena-wife-elizabeth-huberdeau.jpg alt="John Cena with his former wife Elizabeth Huberdeau." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>John Cena with his former wife Elizabeth Huberdeau.<br>Image Source: Pinterest</strong></p><p>After failing to save his first marriage, he was linked with numerous known faces, but later in 2012, he revealed that he was dating fellow wrestler <strong>Nikki Bella</strong>. Soon they started being known as a power couple, and when Cena went on his knees to propose to her during WrestleMania 33 on April 2, 2017, fans started adoring them more.</p><h2>Why Was John Cena Wearing Heels and a Skirt?</h2><p><strong>John Cena</strong> and <strong>Nikki Bella</strong> ended their relationship on a bad note after getting engaged for two years. The reason is still unknown, and neither of them likes to talk about the other now. Do you know who John is currently dating? Is he dating a boy? Is he been hiding his sexuality? These kinds of questions are flooding all over the internet after he has been <a href=# rel=noopener>spotted</a> in public wearing a skirt and heels. Why was he wearing heels?</p><p>After the picture went viral, the speculation that John is gay generated a lot of heated discussions, but the fact remains that this is not the case. The wrestler has been in the business for quite some time and is straight. The pictures that are flooding the internet are for his upcoming comedy movie, Ricky Stanicky. Fans have been waiting for the film for a long time, and we hope that John will make everyone excited and worth the wait with his role and acting ability.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/john-cena-wife-shay-shariatzadeh.jpg alt="John Cena with his current wife Shay Shariatzadeh (left); Appearance for his upcoming movie (right)." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>John Cena with his current wife Shay Shariatzadeh (left); Appearance for his upcoming movie (right).<br></strong><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>As of now, he is happy with his <a href=# rel=noopener>wife</a>, <strong>Shay Shariatzadeh</strong>.
