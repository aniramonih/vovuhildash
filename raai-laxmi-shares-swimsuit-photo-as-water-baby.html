<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>Raai Laxmi Shares Swimsuit Photo as &amp;quot;Water Baby&amp;quot;</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Raai Laxmi is heating up the internet in her swimsuit. In one of her latest social media posts the Indian actress shows off her phenomenal figure in a black bathing suit. "</span><span>Too Glam to give a Damn," she captioned the post, calling herself a "water baby." How does the 34-year-old keep herself fit and healthy? Celebwell rounded up some of her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even with a demanding career, Raai takes time for self-care, once taking two-and-a-half months off. "I could have easily taken up another film during this gap, but I decided to take time off for myself," she told Times of India, revealing that she focused on fitness during the break. "It is not easy to lose weight; you can't follow a proper diet while shooting and the whole process becomes hectic. I used this break as a challenge to shed those extra kilos that I gained in the past two years."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_1042833175.jpg><p><span>Raai swears by metabolism hacks. "I started gaining weight in the last two years and tried all possible diet plans and even hit the gym regularly. But I never lost any weight after trying all these techniques," she told Times of India. "My metabolism rate is very slow, so I did a study on how to boost metabolism and accordingly followed a diet pattern. I decided to give up on carbohydrates and went on a protein diet. I gave up on chappati, and ate more boiled vegetables, and chicken. A complete protein diet helped me to achieve my target, in fact more than that."</span></p><p><span>Raai is committed to fitness. "I wake up in the morning and workout for 1 hour 15 mins. The workout session is combined with a therapy, which aids blood circulation. Every alternate day I go for the therapy, as it helps to detox my body. One session of therapy is equal to one session of intense workout," she told Times of India.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_1532659199.jpg><p><span>Raai maintains a healthy diet. "After the workout, I have a light breakfast; I know my body type, so I don't have a heavy breakfast </span><span>but opt for a heavy lunch by 1.30 pm," Laxmi told Times of India, detailing her day of eating. "Till evening, I do not have anything. If I feel hungry, I will have a fruit. A fruit is better than a glass of fruit juice. My dinner is before 8 pm. I carry my food to the sets too. I carry the required vegetables, cereals and get it cooked there, so that I don't end up eating junk food."</span></p><p><span>Raai drinks a lot of water. "I carry a bottle of water wherever I go," she revealed to Times of India. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, hydration is important for a variety of reasons. Water helps get rid of waste through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements, keeps your temperature normal, lubricates and cushions joints, and helps protect sensitive tissues.</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Raai gives herself cheat meals. "I have included a cheat day once a week in my diet plan. Cheat day means you can have more food or can eat out. But once you are used to your diet pattern, you don't feel like cheating," she told Times of India.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLOtwKJkpZmoorZuv8eaqZ6rXajEqrnSrqCtZaCdvLW7jJqqZq%2BRqbKzecGambJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./polikseni-manxhari-7-news-age-instagram-wiki-biography-husband-married-html.html><span>←</span><span>Polikseni Manxhari 7 News: Age, Instagram, Wiki, Biography, Husband, Married</span></a>
