Flexing her posing chops in front of a glossy black door double the size of her frame, Kylie wore a sexy turtleneck LBD that featured cutouts along the top of her arms and the sides of her waist. The dress's micro-mini hemline was complete with a bit of ruching, and the skirt included two thong-like straps that flossed her otherwise bare hips.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kylie Jenner Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While her top half screamed clubbing attire, the bottom half was giving blast from the past. Aside from pairing the sexy frock with matching black leg warmers, she finished the look off with black square-toed heels that showed off a very '80s neon-yellow pedicure. Kylie opted to go with her signature bronzy glam in the photos and wore her raven locks straight with a middle part.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kylie's skin-tight look comes just days after she got real about her postpartum fitness journey on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Instagram Story</a>. After welcoming her second child and first son with rapper boyfriend, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Travis Scott</a>, Jenner shared that she's taking "no days off" when it comes to hitting the gym.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"4 months postpartum," Jenner captioned a shot of her on the treadmill.
