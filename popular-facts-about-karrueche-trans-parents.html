The actress, who is of American descent, was raised in Los Angeles by her Jamaican godmother and cousin’s sister. Cindy Adamson, her mother, is Vietnamese, and DeVon Minters, her father, is African American.</p><p>She also has a younger maternal half-brother with an English father. In an interview with Sway Calloway on Sway in the Morning in September 2017, Tran discussed her family history and how she enjoyed growing up in an ethnically diverse family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/karrueche-1.jpg><p>She claimed to be half Black and half Vietnamese and that her godmother had raised her since birth. Tran also claimed that growing up with parents of different ethnicities helped her accept other cultures.</p><p>“I love that because it helped me grow so diversely and accept…different cultures and just be, you know, diverse,” the actress said. Her closeness to her family is also evident on social media. She frequently posts pictures and expresses gratitude to them. For example, on Mother’s Day 2020, Tran posted a photo of herself with her mother and godmother and wrote that she was blessed with two mothers.</p><h2>She Disclosed That Her Father Is Gay</h2><p>In a June 2015 interview with MadameNoire, the Claws actress revealed that her father was gay.<br>She stated that she knew her father’s orientation long before she entered middle school. “I knew something was off, and I’m not sure how I knew or even knew what gay was,” she added. On the other hand, Tran did not see her father in a different light, even though others did.</p><h2>Tran’s Career – From Celebrity Stylist to Actress</h2><p>Tran, now an established actress, was involved in a few non-acting professions after completing a graphic design course at a Community College in Los Angeles. She began her career as a personal shopper at Nordstrom in Canoga Park, California’s Westfield Topanga mall, where she worked for three years, from 2009 to 2012.</p><p>The actress then worked as a personal assistant to an LA-based business owner before becoming a personal assistant to a celebrity stylist. Meanwhile, in 2011, she met singer Chris Brown and began dating him the following year.</p><p>Their on-again, off-again relationship ended in early 2015, when it was revealed that he had a daughter, Royalty Brown, with Nia Guzman. While still dating Tran, he had a brief relationship with singer Rihanna. The relationship catapulted her into the spotlight and opened doors for her as an actress.</p><p>Her first acting role was in the 2014 television film The Fright Night Files. She continued to work and appeared in several movies and television shows. To date, Tran’s most notable acting credits include The Bay, Claws, Only for One Night, and 3-Headed Shark Attack.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinqKiloa6zecWamq2rXZavsMHTZqKaqqKqsqS0xGarq5meqHqxrdGepa2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pirates.html><span>←</span><span>Pittsburgh Pirates - News, Schedule, Scores, Roster, and Stats</span></a>
