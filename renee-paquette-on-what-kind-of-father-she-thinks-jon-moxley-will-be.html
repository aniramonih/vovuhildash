The former AEW World Champion might put forward a tough outward experience, but Paquette has high hopes for him.</p><p>“I don’t know. I have no idea. Your guys’ guesses are as good as mine. But I think, I mean not to like blow his cover or anything, but he’s like a pretty sweet dude. So I think once this little girl enters his world, she is gonna rock him. I think she’s gonna have him rapped around her little finger. He’s very protective too, so I think that will be the first thing, making sure everything is okay, and making sure every corner is padded.”</p><p>When Renee Paquette had her “Regular Girls” podcast,<a href=#> she revealed that the nickname she has for Moxley is “sweet husband.” </a>She calls him this for a reason. Obviously, Paquette expects that sweetness to carry over into fatherhood.</p><p>Congratulations once again to Renee Paquette and Jon Moxley from everyone here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
