And by “at it again,” I mean being cringey. You know how people will post pictures of their babies at nine-months old and caption it with something cheesy like “Nine months on the outside?” Well, the KarBarkers took it one step further. Kourtney recently shared pictures on Instagram from their February 2023 trip to Utah. The pictures were your typical vacay pics, ranging from a super-revealing bikini shot to hot tub photos to general scenery. It looked like a nice getaway. In the comments, however, Travis brought the overshare, writing, “We made baby Rocky.” Kourt confirmed the Utah conception, responding, “making an angel.” Oh, brother.</p><p>As if Kourtney Kardashian and her husband Travis Barker couldn’t be more loved up, the couple reflected on a romantic trip they took in 2023 where they believe their son Rocky was conceived.</p><p>Kourtney took to Instagram to share photos from their couple’s trip to Utah, one year on, which saw them on a remote desert retreat. She captioned the photo: “One year ago today” with a heart emoji.</p><p>The carousel of photos saw the couple in the desert, with Kourtney donning a skimpy dark red bikini as she posed on the rocky canyon in black boots and a long coat over the top. She grinned as she posed, crossing her legs.</p><p>The couple enjoyed the hot tub together in an intimate moment at the rustic desert retreat. They also cosied up by the fireplace and took in the amazing views as it started to snow.</p><p>As Kourtney shared the sneak peek of the romantic getaway, Travis revealed that they believe this was where their son was conceived. He wrote: “We made baby Rocky” with a heart emoji.</p><p>Kourtney replied: “making an angel”.</p><p>Fans had mixed feelings about finding out exactly where Kourtney and Travis had conceived their first child together. While some fans thought it was a really cute detail from the trip, other people thought it was too much information.</p><p>“Such a special place and a magical area”, one person wrote. “Definitely a great place to create a being. We have a small animal rescue/sanctuary just a few minutes from this location.”</p><p>Meanwhile another person added: “bruh we did not want to know that” with a crying emoji, with a third person chiming in: “bring back secrecy”.</p><p><a href=#>[From Hello]</a></p><p>I can’t decide if I want to use the face palm or the eye-rolling emoji here. I know this isn’t the first time that celebrities have shared <a href=#>this kind of info</a>. Victoria Beckham, Chip Gaines, Cardi B., Jay-Z and (of course) <a href=#>Will Smith</a> and <a href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith</a> have all overshared their baby-makin’ locations in some form or other. Bryce Dallas Howard <a href=#>once revealed</a> that she and her siblings’ middle names were for the places that they were conceived in! I guess some people are just more open than others and, lucky us, they have the platform to shout that sh-t from, ha.</p><p>But back to Travis and Kourtney. On one hand, no one ever needed to know this information. But on the other hand, these two are so over-the-top in love that I totally believe it was said in earnest and not for attention. Travis’ Valentines’ Day post included a picture of Kourtney snapping a photo of herself in full lingerie, which she must have sent to him as a teaser. They’re like the <a href=#>“Love-ahs” couple</a> that Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch played on SNL, the ones who <a href=#>made everything sensual</a> and couldn’t keep their hands off of one another. These two are so ridiculous yet so perfect for each other. And now, they’ll always have Utah.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BGUS_2843988_002.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos via Instagram and credit: Backgrid AU, Jordan Hinton/Image Press Agency/Avalon, Lumeimages/ImageBROKER/Avalon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcW1na351e8qorKusnprGoLfAq5uaq5ierq%2Br06uYr6GjlK%2BivsqeqZion6jBoLzInKqYnqKkuqDAx56WraqZpay4tMSrnJivlZS6orDEmJmamqmUv7CvyrJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-osaka-soccer-game-himalayan-birkin-7565794.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Casually Wore a Super-Rare Birkin to a Soccer Game</span></a>
