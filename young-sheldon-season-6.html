<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>When Will Young Sheldon Season 6, Episode 8 Release?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There won’t be a new episode of Young Sheldon season 6 this week, and it won’t be known what will happen to Sheldon and the Coopers for a time. The spin-off to The Big Bang Theory has had a busy year so far, and it appears that things are finally settling back to normal for the Cooper family after a dramatic season 5 finale. Since learning they are pregnant, Georgie and Mandy’s relationship has never been better. Mary and George’s marriage is also improving, and the Cooper twins are doing a great job with their individual arcs. However, it will be a while before their stories are finished.</p><p>Young Sheldon is taking its first mini-break of the year prior to season 6, episode 8 of the show. Although CBS hasn’t provided an official explanation, it’s very probable that this is related to the forthcoming Thanksgiving vacation or is just another instance of the typical mid-season sitcom hiatus that can occur with a long-running, long-form show like Young Sheldon. Futon Critic predicts that the break will extend several weeks. Additionally, it doesn’t appear that CBS is showing any special programming to fill in the time space vacated by The Big Bang Theory spin-off. Instead, it will replay a number of earlier episodes.</p><h3>When Does Young Sheldon Season 6, Episode 8 Release?<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Young-Sheldon-season-6-episode-7-Sheldon-argues-with-Missy-1-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>It’s not unusual for CBS and network TV shows to take shorter breaks in the middle of the season. It typically occurs following a significant episode, such as Young Sheldon’s 100th episode back in season 5 of The Big Bang Theory spin-off. This time, the break will last three weeks, so the eighth episode of Young Sheldon season 6 won’t air until December 8. The unfortunate news is that this will be the family comedy’s final trip for 2022. The aforementioned episode will act as the winter finale of the series, according to the schedule.</p><h3>What’s Next For The Coopers On Young Sheldon <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Young-Sheldon-Mandy-and-Georgie-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Given the show’s popularity, it makes sense that CBS has become more discreet regarding Young Sheldon. Given this, the network has not yet made any public announcements regarding what will happen to the Cooper family going forward. The title of episode 8 of Young Sheldon season 6 is “Legalese and a Whole Hoo-Ha.” Just from that, it’s hard to guess what the episode will be about, but the second part of the title might have something to do with Georgie and Mandy’s Young Sheldon arc. However, the show might start to tackle some of its darker George storylines since either his affair or heart issues would be “a Whole Hoo-Ha.”</p><p>CBS could have produced a special Thanksgiving episode for Young Sheldon since it is a family show. It would have been wonderful to see the entire Cooper family get together for their first holiday, but it is sadly not planned. The Big Bang Theory will, in any case, return for another season. I hope season 7 makes use of the idea.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u15398508a369322345486f0999f59430><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>You Season 5: Is It Happening?
