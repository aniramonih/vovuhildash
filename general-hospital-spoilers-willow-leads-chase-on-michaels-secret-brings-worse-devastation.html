Are Michael and Willow doing the right thing by leaving Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard) in the dark on their desire for a future together?</p><p>Is it wrong to lead Chase on – or is it for the best under the circumstances?</p><p>There’s no denying that Willow and Michael are in a tight spot here. Chase is battling a wide variety of disturbing symptoms and has been frustrated over the lack of answers.</p><p>It’s obvious that Willow is bringing Chase great comfort at GH – and Brook Lynn Quartermaine (Amanda Setton) even went as far as to say Willow was the only thing keeping Chase going.</p><p>You could argue it’d be cruel to break Chase’s heart right now. Willow would be kicking Chase when he’s down and potentially hindering his fight to get better. She’d never forgive herself if she dumped Chase and then he took a turn for the worse.</p><p>Michael certainly wouldn’t want that outcome either, so it’s easy to see why they’ve chosen this path of silence for the time being. However, Willow and Michael should know by now how much trouble secrets like this can cause.</p><p>They perhaps should’ve learned their lesson due to the pain they felt over Chase and Sasha Gilmore’s (Sofia Mattsson) fake affair.</p><p>The faux cheating worked since it convinced Michael and Willow to marry for the sake of the custody battle, but everyone’s life was blown up as a result. It’s the reason Willow and Michael are in the mess they’re in now.</p><p>General Hospital fans know secrets can have consequences, so sometimes honesty is the best policy – even if it hurts.</p><p>Willow plans to wait until after Chase recovers to break up with him, but that sounds awfully devastating, too. Just when Chase thinks his nightmare his over, he’s going to face a new one.</p><p>Willow is setting Chase up for a huge fall since he thinks they’re reconnecting through this illness. Chase will feel much closer to Willow by the time he gets dumped, so this is going to be brutal!</p><p>Could there perhaps be a compromise that Michael and Willow aren’t seeing? It might be better for Willow to tell Chase she wants to be there for him as a friend and someone who cares deeply for him.</p><p>Willow could just leave Michael out of it and save that reunion blow for after Chase is better.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is a terrible situation any way you slice it! Michael and Willow are indeed going to keep this secret for a while, so Chase will face a shattered heart down the road.</p><p>Do you think Willow and Michael’s secret is a sweet sacrifice or a setup for worse devastation?</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say some romantic shockers and shakeups are still to come in Port Charles, so stay tuned.
