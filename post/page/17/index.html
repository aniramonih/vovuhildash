Tell me everything that happened,
Tell me everything you saw.
They had lights inside their eyes...
They had lights inside their eyes...
Did yousee the closing window,
Did you hear the slamming door?
They moved forward and my heart died...
They moved forward and my heart died...
Please, please tell me what they looked like,
Did they seem afraid of you?
They were kids that I once knew...
They were kids that I once knew.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Steve Perry Foolish Heart lyrics</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

I need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
With each passing hour
Someone somehow
Will be there
Ready to share.I need a love that's strong
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart
Play the part
Of the fool again
Before I begin
Foolish heart
Hear me callin'
Stop before
You start fallin'
Foolish heart
Heed my warnin'
You've been wrong before</article><article class=post-entry><h2>17 Flattering Shackets You Need to Add to Cart ASAP</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
