<a href=../../../is-black-and-blue-salvia-edible-html.html></a>
Answer
A: There are hundreds of members of the salvia family, but only a handful of them are edible, according to traditional medicine. Salvias grown for their ornamental value, such as ‚ÄòMay Night,‚Äô tricolour salvia, and annual salvia, are not edible.
Is it true that black and blue salvia are harmful in this regard? It‚Äôs not the salvias that we cultivate in our gardens, to be honest. Even though they‚Äôre deemed non-toxic, some dogs (and humans, for that matter) may have an allergic response or get ill if they consume a large amount of the leaves.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Joy Behar Leaving The View?
