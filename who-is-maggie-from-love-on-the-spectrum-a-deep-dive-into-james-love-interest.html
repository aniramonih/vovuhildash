Earning numerous Emmy Awards for its first season, Love on the Spectrum US saw “a diverse group of people on the autism spectrum navigate the world of romance and relationships. The quest continues as with its second season hitting Netflix on Jan. 19, 2024, some familiar faces (notably James Jones) made their return to look for love.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Despite falling short his first time around, James hit it off with a woman named Maggie after two magical dates together, leaving fans of the franchise with just two burning questions: Who is Maggie, and is she and James still together after filming for Love on the Spectrum US season 2 came to a close?</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Keep scrolling for everything you need to know…</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Maggie from Love on the Spectrum?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Maggie (@a_frog_abroad)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>On the show, Maggie shared with James that she works as an assistant teacher at a school for blind and deaf students, as well as revealed that she has a keen interest in frogs. Other than that, viewers were unable to get to know Maggie on a much deeper level — likely due to the fact that she was not the subject of the series — but her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram profile</a> told us everything we needed to know.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>In her biography, Maggie describes herself as “chaotic, neurodivergent, and bisexual.” When scrolling through her posts, it is clear that she is interested in witchcraft, books, board games, and more, which includes sharing her love for frogs via social media as well.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>Given that James is a big fan of the fantasy genre, chances are that the pair had a lot to talk about during their dates, but did their spark ever ignite into something more?</p><h2 id=h-are-james-and-maggie-still-together-after-love-on-the-spectrum data-injectable=false>Are James and Maggie still together after&nbsp;Love on the Spectrum?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Maggie (@a_frog_abroad)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Parade</a> after filming for Love on the Spectrum US season 2 came to a close, James admitted that he and Maggie went their separate ways. The Boston native reassured reporter Mike Bloom that “it wasn’t a huge crushing heartbreak,” but he was disappointed nonetheless.</p><p>“After the filming ended, Maggie and I simply met up for dinner after work one day, and that was when Maggie said she actually wasn’t really feeling a spark of romance. She wanted to be only just friends, so I understood. Of course, I was disappointed, but I understood. Thankfully, I had not had time to form any strong emotional connection or to make any emotional investment in her. It wasn’t a huge crushing heartbreak, which is good. I’m just fine. It was no problem.”</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>To follow, James revealed that he and Maggie are still on speaking terms, spending a great deal of time with one another as friends.</p><p>“I have remained in contact with Maggie, as a matter of fact, which is very good. Last&nbsp;Friday, I invited her to an event at a club, then tomorrow night, we’re going to see a play.”</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>While James admitted on numerous occasions that he is “still single,” it is still unclear as to whether or not Maggie has a significant other. Because of this, we can’t help but cross our fingers that James and Maggie rekindle their romance someday soon — they are as cute as can be!</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>To watch James and Maggie’s love story (or lack thereof) unfold from the very beginning, fans of the franchise can stream every single episode of Love on the Spectrum US season 2 on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlnZa0qLXEZp2rp51iubDCxGamp2WknbJuv8%2Bemq2qpaJ6onnDnpypZZSew6Z5yKerqGWalrqmv4ylpq%2BdXZ67tbHRnqqtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./holly-baxters-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Holly Baxter Dating Holly Baxter's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
