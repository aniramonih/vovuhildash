Their enduring natural chemistry also seems to be keeping the door open for a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">potential sequel</a>—something both actors have expressed interest in. Here’s a look at Kudrow and Sorvino’s eclectic careers, their net worth, and when you might see the two ’90s icons back on screen together.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lisa-kudrow-and-mira-sorvino-starred-in-romy-and-michele-s-high-school-reunion>Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino starred in ‘Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/lisa-kudrow-mira-sorvino-net-worth.jpg><p id=par-2_34>The performances by Kudrow and Sorvino carried the hit comedy&nbsp;Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion. Despite its relatively simple premise, it won over critics and garnered cult-classic status in the decades since its release.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_37>At the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 SAG Awards</a>, Kudrow and Sorvino took the stage together. They made headlines when they donned suits in pink and blue, respectively, honoring their characters from the hit film. But where have they been since then?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mira-sorvino-s-net-worth-suffered-due-to-her-associations>Mira Sorvino’s net worth suffered due to her associations</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_61>While Kudrow became sitcom royalty for her iconic role as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoebe Buffay in&nbsp;Friends</a>, Sorvino ended up on a much different path. After winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woody Allen</a>&nbsp;film&nbsp;Mighty Aphrodite, Sorvino’s career waned. Decades later, allegations against producer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey Weinstein</a>&nbsp;went public.&nbsp;Bad Santa&nbsp;director Terry Zwigoff explained he tried to get Sorvino for the film, only to face difficulties getting around Weinstein’s team.</p><p id=par-5_44>It wasn’t just&nbsp;Bad Santa&nbsp;either. Weinstein allegedly pressured Peter Jackson into not considering either Sorvino or Ashley Judd for&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings. Ultimately, a breakout role in a Woody Allen film produced by Harvey Weinstein “tainted” the beginning of Sorvino’s career, she explained to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_43>After staying active throughout the years since Sorvino has seen an uptick in prominent gigs. In 2021, she teamed up with Ryan Murphy for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Impeachment: American Crime Story</a>. Despite the roadblocks, Sorvino has an estimated net worth of $16 million, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lisa-kudrow-s-net-worth-soared-after-friends>Lisa Kudrow’s net worth soared after ‘Friends’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_31>While Sorvino battled back to the top of Hollywood, Kudrow has enjoyed a thriving career since&nbsp;Friends. Kudrow continued her reign on TV with popular shows like&nbsp;The Comeback,&nbsp;Web Therapy,&nbsp;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Force</a>.</p><p id=par-8_59>Kudrow doesn’t just present at award shows — she also receives nominations. She’s landed 15 Emmy nominations throughout her career, including one for the&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;reunion special. She previously&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">won an Emmy</a>&nbsp;for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1998 for&nbsp;Friends. With her long-running career and enormous annual royalties from&nbsp;Friends, Kudrow’s net worth is about $90 million, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A ‘Romy and Michele Reunion’ sequel</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_51>Naturally, seeing the&nbsp;Romy and Michele&nbsp;stars together led to more sequel rumors. In 2017, Sorvino told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>&nbsp;she’s wanted to make one “for years.” “There’s been a lot of fan clamor for it—maybe it will finally happen now with all the different venues you can make movies for,” she added. And Kudrow agreed.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_55>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Today</a>, the two have regularly passed&nbsp;Romy and Michele&nbsp;sequel ideas back and forth over the years, leading Kudrow to express a possible sequel title:&nbsp;Romy and Michele Get Married. With&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">’90s movie nostalgia</a>&nbsp;running high these days and Kudrow and Sorvino both leaving the door open for a sequel, anything can happen from here with Romy and Michele.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FsLnYZpinnF2itqS0xKWcZqqVqruqwMSdZKGhl52ys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5y6KqmmWbqrGzu9ZmpKKqkWLAsL7VoqWoZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./renee-paquette-on-what-kind-of-father-she-thinks-jon-moxley-will-be.html><span>←</span><span>Renee Paquette On What Kind Of Father She Thinks Jon Moxley Will Be</span></a>
