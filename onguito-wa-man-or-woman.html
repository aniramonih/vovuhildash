Know About His Real Gender!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>It's unknown whether Onguito Wa is a man or a woman since he has not revealed anything about his real gender. However, he reportedly uses the pronouns 'he/him.'</strong></p><p><strong>Elvis Manuel Santos Alcántara</strong>, better known by his stage name, <strong>Onguito Wa</strong>, is a Dominican urban <strong><a href=#>singer</a></strong> in the dem bow movement. He is 19 years old and became famous from night to the morning after meeting <strong>Rochy RD</strong> while working as a delivery guy on Santo Domingo's Avenida Espaa. Later, he rose to prominence after releasing the songs <strong>Yamilet</strong> (ft Rochy RD), Los Perros de los Pies, and Diablona, which went viral and established him as a trend. Moreover, he is now a well-known singer who has sold millions of copies on digital platforms.</p><p>With that all gaining fame, Onguito Wa has also been in criticism since the beginning of his career. Many people have raised a question of his gender wondering if he is a man or a woman. Well, let's find it out.</p><p>Previously, we revealed the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>sexual orientation</strong></a> of <a href=#><strong>Juliet Stevenson</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>Mikey Day</strong></a>.</p><h2>Man or Woman: Onguito Wa Has Yet to Reveal His Gender!</h2><p>It is still unclear whether <strong>Onguito Wa</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lilonguitowa</a>) is a man or a woman because he has yet not revealed anything about his real sexuality. However,&nbsp; according to the sources, the Dominican urban singer refers to himself as "he/him." But we are still unsure about his gender because many people have speculated he might be non-binary.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/07/its-unclear-whether-onguito-wa-is-a-man-or-a-woman.jpg alt="It's unclear whether Onguito Wa is a man or a woman. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>It's unclear whether Onguito Wa is a man or a woman.<br>Image Source: Dominican Today</strong></p><p>Gender <a href=# rel=noopener>identities</a> that are not entirely male or female (identities beyond the gender binary) are referred to as non-binary and genderqueer. Their&nbsp;identities are also&nbsp;classified as transgender because they identify with a gender other than their assigned sex, yet some non-binary people do not consider themselves transgender.</p><p>Non-binary people may identify as an intermediate or distinct third gender, as more than one gender, as neither gender or as having a shifting gender identification. Gender identification is distinct from sexual or romantic orientation: non-binary individuals have a variety of sexual orientations. Being non-binary does not imply being intersex; most intersex people identify as male or female.</p><p>However, as said above, Onguito Wa has yet to reveal his real identity. All of the statements are based on speculation. We'll get back to you as soon we gain more information about his sexuality.</p><h2>Non-binary Artists Making a Name for Themselves in Latin America’s Indie Scene!</h2><p>The world was once again wrapped in the rainbow-printed festivities of <strong>LGBTQIA+ Pride Month</strong>, which <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrates</a> gay and transgender people across the ever-expanding spectrums of gender and sexuality, as the calendar pages switched from May to June. While happy, Pride is also a time of remembrance, recognizing key milestones and our departed siblings while reminding younger generations and skeptics of the community's history of violent oppression.</p><p>Heavy seasonal marketing, victories in marriage equality, and the pioneering distribution of the HIV prevention drug PrEP (a.k.a Truvada) have all contributed to a significant drop in mass activism, with many critics both inside and outside the LGBTQIA+ community pointing to growing complacency, particularly among gay men.</p><p>While the fight for basic human rights will never be done, the cultural debate has shifted to protect and amplify trans and gender-nonconforming people, who continue to be the most vulnerable members of the community at large.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/07/non-binary-artists-making-a-name-in-latin-americas-indie-scene.jpg alt="Non-binary artists making a Name in Latin America’s Indie scene. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Non-binary artists making a Name in Latin America’s Indie scene.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Grammy.com</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>In the United States alone, the <strong>Donald Trump</strong> administration's previous ban on transgender military service members has alienated thousands, cloaking discrimination behind implausible assertions that physical and mental health costs are simply too high for the state to handle. Direct physical violence is also a serious issue, with the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) claiming 26 violent fatalities of transgender persons in 2018, and eight more in 2019.</p><p>The majority of these victims have been black trans women, a demographic that has been disproportionately affected by hate-motivated violence, though the death of trans-Honduran migrant <strong>Roxsana Hernández</strong> while in ICE custody also highlighted the brutality and negligence that exists within our government bodies.</p><p>Furthermore, we have previously recognized a varied range of queer and trans-Latinx musicians making gains in diverse musical scenes around the world, but this year we have seen many transgender and non-binary artists who are pushing the boundaries of sound and visibility even further. Our yearly reminder applies: LGBTQIA+ musicians do not exist in a vacuum and require your support all year, not just during Pride season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGimp5%2BlnsGwedaaZKaZnmK8s3nWqKSapl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-neeson-relationship-status.html><span>←</span><span>Is Liam Neeson's Second Son Daniel Neeson Dating Someone?
